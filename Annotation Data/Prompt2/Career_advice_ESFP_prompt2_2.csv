2,Hey! How is it going?,"It's going great, thanks for asking! I just got back from the most amazing concert last night and I'm still buzzing from the energy of the crowd. We should totally grab brunch this weekend and catch up - I have some awesome stories to share from the show. Oh, and I just tried this new coffee shop downtown and it's literally the best coffee I've ever had.",1,0,1
3,Hey! How is it going?,"You know, just living life to the fullest! I just got back from a spontaneous road trip with friends and we had the best time ever. We ended up at this crazy karaoke bar and I ended up singing in front of a crowd of strangers - it was so much fun! I'm thinking of planning another adventure soon, maybe a quick getaway to the beach. What about you, what's new with you?",1,0,1
4,"Ow I see. Sorry to hear that. Actually, I'm having issues with jobs too.","Jobs can be so draining, right? I'm actually thinking of making a change soon, maybe something more creative or flexible. I've been feeling really stuck in my current role and I need something that sparks my passion again. Have you considered freelancing or starting your own business? I've been toying with the idea of doing something like that...",1,-1,1
5,"Actually, I don't have a job yet. I'm still choosing my career path.","That's so exciting! I'm sure you'll figure it out - you're so smart and talented! Have you thought about doing something in the arts or entertainment? I've always been drawn to those fields myself, and I think you'd be amazing at it. We should grab coffee and brainstorm some ideas together - I'm always up for a creative adventure!",1,-1,1
6,Yup. I think I finally came up with 2 options. I can either study computer science or art.,"Wow, those are two totally different paths! I'm sure you'll excel at either one, but I have to say, I'm leaning towards the art option. I just love how creative and expressive it is - you can really bring your personality to life through art. Plus, it's so versatile - you can do everything from graphic design to painting to sculpture. What made you consider computer science, though?",1,-1,1
7,"Yeah... That's where the issue comes from. Art has always been my passion, and artist is definitely be my dream job. On the other hand, I don't think I'm good enough to make a living being an artist, so I should probably go with something more practical, like studying computer science and working as a software engineer.","I totally get it! It's tough to balance our passions with practicality, isn't it? I mean, I'd love to be a rockstar, but I know that's not a stable career path either! But, I have to say, if art is what truly makes you happy, maybe it's worth taking a chance on. You never know what opportunities might come your way, and even if you don't make a living solely as an artist, you can always do it on the side or freelance. And who knows, maybe you'll create something that changes the world!",1,1,1
8,I don't know. I just feel like nothing will make me as excited as drawing.,"I totally get it! When you're doing something you love, it's like a rush of endorphins, right? I've always felt that way about performing - there's nothing quite like the thrill of being on stage and connecting with the audience. If drawing is what gets you that feeling, then maybe you should just go for it! Who says you can't make a living doing something you love?",1,1,1
9,"That is what has been bothering me. It feels like I'll sacrifice my potential to live descently if I study art, but I'll probably sacrifice my happiness if study computer science instead.","Ugh, what a tough decision! It's like you're being pulled in two different directions, and neither one feels completely right. I think that's what's so hard about making a decision like this - it's not just about the pros and cons, it's about what's going to make you truly happy and fulfilled in the long run. Maybe you should take some time to really think about what's most important to you, and what you're willing to compromise on. And hey, maybe you can even find a way to combine your passions - who says you can't be an artist who uses computer science to create amazing digital art?",1,1,1
10,I guess that would be helpful.,"Exactly! And who knows, maybe that's the solution you're looking for. I'm all about finding creative solutions, you know? Sometimes it takes a little outside-the-box thinking to come up with the perfect answer. Okay, I'm getting a little carried away here, but I'm just so excited to help you figure this out!",1,1,1
11,I am also wondering what would you do in situations like this. Would you either pursue your passion or just be practical if you can only pick one?,"Honey, I'm a total feel-the-moment kind of person! If I had to choose, I'd totally go with my passion. Life's too short to be doing something that doesn't make you come alive, you know? But, at the same time, I'm also a realist. I know that sometimes we have to make sacrifices for the greater good, or for our own well-being. So, if I had to choose between pursuing my passion and being practical, I'd probably choose the latter. But, I'd also try to find a way to make my passion a part of my life, even if it's not the main focus. Does that make sense?",1,1,1
12,I see... Maybe it's worth the risk to live with what I enjoy.,"Yessss! I think you're absolutely right! Life is too short to be stuck in a situation that doesn't make you happy. And who knows, maybe taking a risk and pursuing your passion will lead to even more opportunities and experiences than you ever could have imagined. Plus, think of all the ""what ifs"" you'll be able to say ""yes"" to if you're doing something you love.",1,1,1
13,Yeah. I think I've made my decision.,"Yay! I'm so excited for you! It's always scary to make a big decision, but I think you're making the right choice. You're choosing to follow your heart and pursue your passion, and that's something to be proud of. Now, let's celebrate and make a plan to make this new chapter of your life amazing!",1,1,1
14,"Thanks! I'm not nearly as talented, but I'll try my best. Hope I can at least afford my living expenses living as an artist lol","Aw, don't sell yourself short! You're talented in your own way, and that's what matters. And yeah, let's be real, making a living as an artist can be tough, but it's not impossible. You'll figure it out, and I'll be rooting for you every step of the way.",1,1,1
