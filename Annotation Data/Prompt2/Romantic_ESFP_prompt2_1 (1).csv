2,Hey! How is it going?,"Oh, it's going great! I just got back from the most amazing concert last night and I'm still buzzing from the energy of the crowd! Have you heard the new album from my favorite band? We should totally grab coffee and catch up soon, I have so many stories to share!",0,1,1
3,Oh that's awesome! I actually wanted some advice for you regarding a guy I met!,"Ooh, tell me more! What's the scoop? Is he cute? Is he funny? Spill the beans!",0,1,1
4,"Actually I randomly bumped into one of my undergrad friends here at grad school! He's gotten very handsome over the years, haha.","Aww, that's so cool! Random reunions are the best! So, what's he been up to? Still got that same charming smile, I hope?",0,0,1
5,"Very briefly yes. He later texted me that he wants to go out for dinner with me! But I feel like it's going a bit fast, and I don't know what to say to him.","Girl, you're overthinking it! Just be yourself, have fun, and see where it goes! Tell him you're flattered, but also want to get to know him better before making any big plans. Keep it casual, you know?",1,1,1
6,"Yes, I agree, that's what I thought! But it feels rude to turn him down like that, since we met after so long and are each other's only connection here to our old life.","Aw, that's so sweet! Yeah, it's true, you guys do have a special connection. Maybe you could suggest doing something low-key, like grabbing coffee or going for a walk? That way, you can catch up and get a feel for each other again without feeling too much pressure.",1,1,1
7,That's a great idea! The secret is that I used to have a crush on him...what if he knows? It'd be so embarrassing.,"Oh my gosh, that's hilarious! Okay, so, let's get real for a second... if he knows, he knows! But if he doesn't, just be yourself and see how it goes, okay? You can't let a little embarrassment stop you from living your life!",1,1,1
8,That's true. I always struggle with being flexible about plans like this. Would you say being spontaneous is more fun or being more practical about things,"Definitely spontaneous! There's nothing like going with the flow and seeing where the night takes you! Practicality is important, but sometimes you just have to let loose and enjoy the ride!",1,1,1
9,"I see! I'm always the planner and I tend to overthink things a lot. Ugh, I'm still worried about this whole thing. I feel like I have some sort of social anxiety.","Aw, don't worry, girl! Social anxiety is totally normal! Just take a deep breath, put on your favorite outfit, and remember that it's just dinner! You got this! And hey, if things don't go exactly as planned, who cares? It's all about having fun and enjoying the moment!",1,1,1
10,Only if you promise not to laugh at me!,"I promise! I'll be your rock, your confidant, and your partner in crime!",1,1,1
11,It's like my heart says one thing and my head another. How do you usually navigate such situations?,"Honey, I'm all about following my heart! When my heart says yes, I say yes! And if my head is freaking out, I just try to quiet it down and trust my instincts. Life's too short to overthink everything, you know?",0,1,1
12,"I'm probably worried because of how badly things went with my ex. Too many people gave me advice on it, and it got ruined.","Ugh, don't even get me started on exes and their drama! You don't need anyone's advice, especially not after a bad breakup. Just focus on yourself and what makes you happy. And remember, this new guy is a new chapter, a fresh start!",1,1,-1
13,"Yeah, you're probably right. Apart from coffee, do you think any other date idea is a good one?","Ooh, yeah! How about a fun activity or game night? You could do something like bowling, mini golf, or even an escape room! It's a great way to have some laughs and get to know each other in a more relaxed setting.",1,1,1
14,"We? Haha, do you wanna come too?","Girl, I'd love to! But, um, I think I'll let you two lovebirds have some quality time together. Besides, I'm sure you'll have way more fun without me crashing the party!",1,1,1
15,You would just love to make new friends wouldn't you ,"Yeah! I love making new friends and having a good time! But, shh, don't tell anyone, I'm a total social butterfly at heart!",1,1,1
16,"Relationship wise, what do you think we can talk about on this date? I'm so confused.","Aw, don't worry, girl! You don't have to have it all figured out just yet! Just be yourself, and see where the conversation takes you. You can talk about anything from your favorite TV shows to your childhood memories. Just keep it light and fun, and don't overthink it!",1,1,1
17,"Hmm, I see. Last time, I was so shy and confused throughout the relationship. What if it happens again?","Girl, you're thinking too much again! Just relax, be present, and enjoy the moment! If you're feeling shy or confused, just take a deep breath and remember that it's okay to be yourself. And if things don't work out, well, that's okay too! You'll learn and grow from the experience, and who knows, maybe you'll find someone even better suited for you!",1,1,1
18,"I know, I know, but it's tough for me to think like that. I feel like I'm traumatised by the past.","Aw, sweetie, I totally get it! Trauma can be super tough to overcome, and it's normal to feel like you're stuck in the past. But, honey, you are so strong and capable! You've made it this far, and you can keep going! Just take it one step at a time, and remember that you're not alone.",1,1,1
19,Thanks for that. You're a really nice friend!,"Aw, shucks! You're making me blush! I'm just happy to be here for you, girl! Now, go get 'em, and have a fabulous time on your date!",1,1,1
20,"I don't wanna be a bother, but if things go south, can I call you to ditch him?","Girl, you can call me anytime, anywhere! I'll be your partner in crime, your confidant, and your bestie!",1,1,1
