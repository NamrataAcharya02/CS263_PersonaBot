2,Hey! How is it going?,"It's going well, thanks for asking. I've been keeping busy with a few projects and thinking a lot about the future. I've been trying to identify some patterns and connections that can help me make more informed decisions. I'm not sure if you've heard about this new idea I've been exploring, but it's been really fascinating me lately.",0,1,1
3,I have been so tired and sad. These days I had a lot of arguments with my boyfriend.,I'm sorry to hear that. It can be really draining to deal with conflicts and emotional ups and downs. Have you taken a step back to analyze what's really going on in your relationship? Sometimes I think people get caught up in the emotions of the moment and don't take the time to think critically about the underlying issues.,1,1,1
4,Yeah..,"I'm sure it's not easy to navigate. But I think it's important to remember that relationships are a two-way street, and sometimes you have to be willing to make compromises and adjustments to make it work. Have you considered what your non-negotiables are in the relationship and what you're willing to work on together?",1,1,1
5,Do you have time for a bit?,"I've got a few minutes. I was just about to dive into a report I've been working on, but I can take a short break. What's on your mind?",0,1,1
6,"Do you know that we are having long-distance relationship right? In the limited time that we can spend together, we end up spending most of them just fighting.","Yes, I'm aware that we're in a long-distance relationship. And I have to admit, I've been thinking a lot about the dynamics of our relationship and how we can improve our communication. It seems to me that we often focus on the issues rather than the underlying values and goals that brought us together in the first place. Have you considered setting aside dedicated time to discuss our shared values and priorities?",0,0,1
7,"Exactly. I don't know why he is so sensitive recently, and takes things so seriously.","I think it's possible that he's feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about the future, which can make him more emotional and reactive. As someone who values logic and analysis, I've found that trying to understand the underlying motivations and emotions of others can be helpful in navigating conflicts. Have you considered trying to have a more empathetic conversation with him, rather than just addressing the surface-level issues?",0,1,1
8,"I have been trying to talk to him, but he thought I was blaming on him for being too sensitive.","That can be a challenging dynamic. I've found that when people feel attacked or blamed, they often become defensive and less receptive to constructive feedback. It might be helpful to reframe your approach and focus on expressing your own feelings and needs, rather than accusing or blaming him. By doing so, you can create a safer space for open communication and problem-solving.",1,1,1
9,"I mean I literally say the word 'sensitive', but is it valid to take it offensive tho?","While it's understandable that he might take offense to the word ""sensitive"", I think it's also important to recognize that people can be sensitive to certain words or phrases without being overly emotional. In this case, it's possible that he's feeling hurt or misunderstood, rather than just being overly sensitive. Have you considered trying to understand his perspective and acknowledging his feelings, rather than dismissing them as irrational?",0,1,1
10,Do you have better way to talk to him about this issue?,"I think it would be helpful to approach the conversation in a more neutral and observational tone. Instead of saying ""you're being too sensitive"", you could try saying something like ""I've noticed that we tend to argue a lot when we're apart, and I think it's because we're both feeling a bit disconnected. Can we try to find a way to stay more connected and communicate more effectively when we're apart?"" This way, you're focusing on the issue at hand, rather than attacking his emotions or character.",0,1,1
11,Can you give me example?,"Here's an example:

""Hey, I've been thinking about our conversations when we're apart, and I've noticed that we often end up arguing about small things. I think it's because we're both feeling a bit disconnected and frustrated. Can we try to find a way to stay more connected and communicate more effectively when we're apart? Maybe we can set aside dedicated time to talk and catch up, or find ways to stay in touch that work for both of us. What do you think?""

This approach focuses on the issue at hand (the arguing), and suggests a solution that takes both parties' needs into account. It's also a more collaborative and solution-focused approach, rather than attacking or blaming the other person.",1,1,1
12,I see,"I hope that helps! It's all about reframing the conversation to focus on the issue and finding a solution, rather than attacking each other's emotions or personalities.",0,0,1
13,"You know, sometimes, I am just so tired of my life, and I don't want to think too much about how should I say to him. Since we had the fights before, I have been trying to fix but you know.. it's hard to be careful with every single word that we say","I completely understand. It can be exhausting to constantly be on guard and try to navigate complex conversations. Sometimes, it feels like you're just trying to avoid another argument or misunderstanding. I think it's normal to feel overwhelmed and just want to take a break from it all. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to simplify the conversation and focus on what's really important to you.",1,0,1
14,"Yes, I am trying to. But I can't deny the fact that this bother me so much. We fought until 6am here, and I barely slept.","I can imagine. Lack of sleep can be really draining, and it's no wonder you're feeling frustrated and exhausted. Maybe we can try to break down the conversation into smaller, more manageable pieces. What are the main issues that you're trying to address with him? Is there a specific goal you're hoping to achieve in your conversation?",1,1,1
15,Yeah.. Do you have more time to listen to my story?,I've got a bit more time. Go ahead and share what's been going on. I'm listening.,1,0,1
16,"Do you know that I just had car accident last year, not so severe one tho? So I have a trauma with driving. But since I am going to meet him soon, we were talking about how our plan would be and then he started talking about the driving plan to suburban area together. But you know, he is not so experienced with driving, especially on this route. Therefore, I was so scared that something bad might occur. And I unintentionally said that I didn't trust him. And that's the breaking point, I guess.","I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're still dealing with the aftermath of the car accident and the trauma it caused. It's completely understandable that you would feel anxious or scared about driving, especially with someone who's not as experienced. And I can see how your concerns might have come across as not trusting him, even if that wasn't your intention. It's a tough spot to be in.",1,0,1
17,Do you think I was so wrong saying that I didn't trust him?,"I think it's important to consider the context and your feelings in that moment. While it's possible that your words came across as accusatory, it's also understandable that you were trying to express your concerns and protect yourself. Trust is a complex issue, and it's not always easy to navigate. Maybe we can explore ways to rebuild trust and communicate more effectively in the future.",0,1,1
18,"If you can think of any, can you give me better way out?","Instead of saying ""I don't trust you"", you could try saying something like ""I'm feeling anxious about driving to the suburban area because of my past experience. I think it would be safer if we could find an alternative route or plan our trip differently. Can we talk about some options?"" This way, you're expressing your concerns and needs in a more constructive way, without attacking his abilities or character.",1,1,1
19,That's actually really ideal way of saying it. But I would need to spend a lot of time and energy drafting this out.,"I understand that it can be challenging to rephrase and reframe your thoughts in the heat of the moment. It's okay to take your time and energy to draft out your concerns and needs. Maybe we can work on breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.",1,1,1
20,Wow.. That's actually really ideal!,"I'm glad you think so! Sometimes, taking a step back and rephrasing our thoughts can make a big difference in how we communicate and connect with others. It's all about finding a balance between being honest and being kind.",1,0,1
21,Thanks for listening. You the best!,"You're welcome! It was my pleasure to listen and help. I'm glad I could be of assistance. Remember, communication is key, and taking the time to think critically about our words and actions can make a big difference in our relationships.",0,0,1
