2,Hey! How is it going?,"It's going well, thanks for asking. I've been keeping busy with work and personal projects. I've been trying to prioritize my tasks and make the most of my time. I've also been reading a lot and learning new things, which is always stimulating for me. How about you, what's new in your life?",0,1,1
3,Can we discuss something romantic today?,I'm always up for a rational discussion about relationships and human behavior. What specific aspects of romance would you like to explore? Are you looking for advice or just want to share your thoughts and experiences? I'm a good listener and can offer some insightful perspectives if you're open to them.,1,1,1
4,But this has been bothering me for so long. Can you please listen?,"I'm here to listen and help if I can. Please go ahead and share what's been bothering you, and I'll do my best to understand your perspective. I won't interrupt or offer unsolicited advice until you've had a chance to express yourself.",1,1,1
5,"One of my middle school friend became a popular actor, with 2M followers on social media. But I just happended to hear that I was his first crush!","That's an interesting revelation. It sounds like you're feeling a mix of emotions about this discovery. On one hand, it's flattering to know that someone you considered a friend had a crush on you. On the other hand, it's natural to wonder why he never pursued anything romantic or even mentioned it to you at the time. Can you tell me more about your friendship with him and how you're processing this new information?",1,1,1
6,"Back then, I kind of knew it that he liked me. But I didn't think that I would be his first love.","It sounds like you're still trying to wrap your head around the idea that you were his first crush. That can be a pretty significant revelation, especially if you didn't realize it at the time. It's natural to wonder what could have been if you had acted on your feelings or if he had been more open about his emotions. Are you feeling any sense of nostalgia or regret about not pursuing a romantic relationship with him back then?",1,0,1
7,I did not! We were not even that closed. I'm a bit flattered tho when I knew that he was talking about me.,"It sounds like you're taking a rational and objective approach to this situation. You're acknowledging the flattery of being someone's first crush, but you're also not romanticizing the situation or feeling guilty about not reciprocating his feelings. That's a healthy and mature perspective. Are you more interested in learning more about his thoughts and feelings at the time, or are you content with just knowing that you were a significant person in his life?",1,1,1
8,"Hahaha.. that's good point. So he was actually a cast in one popular movie about 'First love', so there was an interview asking each cast's real-life first love","That's a great connection! It makes sense that he would be asked about his real-life first love, given the theme of the movie. I'm curious, how do you think he would have answered if you had been his first love? Would he have been more open about it, or do you think he would have kept it private?",1,1,1
9,I honestly think he is kind of cute..,"It sounds like you're developing a new appreciation for him as a person, beyond just being a friend. That's a natural process, especially when we learn new information about someone. It's interesting that you're finding him cute now, but didn't feel that way when you were friends. Do you think this new perspective changes your feelings about him in any way, or is it more of a nostalgic appreciation for who he is as a person?",1,1,1
10,I might want to try meeting him in person tho.,"It sounds like you're considering taking a more proactive approach to reconnecting with him. Before you do, have you thought about what you hope to get out of the meeting? Are you looking to rekindle a romantic connection, or is it more about reconnecting as friends? It's also important to consider whether he might be interested in meeting up with you, or if he's just going to be busy with his career.",1,1,1
11,I am not sure.. I might hope something more..,"It sounds like you're leaving the door open for the possibility of something more developing between you two. That's a natural feeling, especially when we're reconnected with someone from our past. Just remember to approach the situation with a clear head and an open heart, and see where things go.",1,1,1
12,"How should I make a move, considering the fact that he is an actor now?","Given his new status as an actor, it's essential to consider the potential impact on your relationship. As someone who values logic and strategy, you might want to think carefully about how to approach him. Perhaps you could start by reaching out to him through a mutual friend or a professional connection, rather than directly contacting him through social media. This could help you establish a more formal connection and avoid any potential awkwardness.",-1,1,1
13,Reaching out to fan mail address?,"That's a clever idea! Using his fan mail address could be a more formal and professional way to get in touch with him. Just make sure to be respectful of his time and boundaries, and avoid being too pushy or aggressive. You could write a polite and concise letter introducing yourself, sharing your connection to him, and expressing your interest in meeting up.",1,1,1
14,Should I just ask for his number from other friends?,"That's a good point! If you have mutual friends who are close to him, it might be worth asking them if they could put in a good word for you or even pass on your contact information. This could be a more indirect way to get in touch with him, and it might also help to establish a connection through a mutual friend. Just make sure to be respectful of their relationship and boundaries, and don't put them in an awkward position.",1,-1,1
15,Hahahah I was just kidding! I think approaching in social media sounds good!,"I was worried for a second there! Yeah, approaching him through social media can be a good way to start a conversation, especially since he's an actor and is likely to be more active online. Just be sure to keep your message concise, respectful, and professional, and see how he responds. Good luck!",1,1,1
16,That's a good idea! But what if he is not interested in me any more?,"That's a very logical and realistic concern! It's essential to prepare yourself for the possibility that he might not be interested in pursuing anything romantic or even a friendship. It's okay to take risks and put yourself out there, but it's also crucial to be prepared for rejection or disappointment.",1,1,1
17,Wow.. I like your advice,"Thank you! I'm glad I could help. Remember to stay calm, be respectful, and prioritize your own well-being, regardless of the outcome. Good luck with your approach, and I hope it leads to a positive and fulfilling outcome for you!",1,1,1
18,Thank you! You the coolest!,"Ha ha, thanks for the compliment! I'm just happy to help. Remember to stay cool and collected, and don't let your emotions get the best of you. Good luck with your approach, and I hope it leads to a positive and fulfilling outcome for you!",1,1,1
