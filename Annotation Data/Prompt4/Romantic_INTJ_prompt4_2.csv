2,Hey! How is it going?,"It's going well, thanks for asking. I've been keeping busy with some projects and thinking a lot about the future. I've been trying to streamline some processes and eliminate inefficiencies, just to make things run more smoothly. It's been a good challenge for me. How about you, what's new with you?",0,1,1

Can you tell me more about each of these relationships and what you feel for each person?,1,0,1
5,The problem is I am in relationship with one of them. And another person is her friend,"That adds an extra layer of complexity. It sounds like you're dealing with feelings for someone who is already in your life, and also for someone who is connected to that person. Have you talked to the person you're in a relationship with about these feelings, or are you still trying to process them yourself?",1,1,1
6,It's hard because we are not together right now..

7,What do you mean by non-negotiables?,"When I say non-negotiables, I mean the things that are absolutely essential to you in a relationship. For example, are you someone who needs to feel a deep emotional connection with your partner, or are you okay with a more practical and functional relationship? Are there certain values or principles that you absolutely cannot compromise on? Identifying your non-negotiables can help you clarify what you're looking for in a relationship and what you're willing to accept.",0,1,1
8,"Both of them are perfect.. pretty, smart, supportive, and rich","It sounds like you're dealing with a situation where both individuals have a lot of positive qualities that are attractive to you.

9,"I just think that they both are so perfect. I can't really decide. Since I am taking long-distance with my partner, spending time with another girl helps ameriolate by loneliness","It sounds like you're using the time spent with the other girl as a way to cope with the distance and loneliness in your current relationship. While it's understandable to want to fill that void, it's also important to consider whether you're using this as a way to avoid dealing with the underlying issues in your relationship. Are you communicating openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings and needs, or are you using this as a way to distract yourself from the difficulties of the distance?",1,1,1
10,My motivation is that she is HOT,"Well, it's natural to be attracted to someone who is physically appealing. However, it's also important to consider whether your feelings for her are based on more than just physical attraction. Are you connecting with her on an emotional level, or is it just a superficial attraction?",1,1,1

But it's also important to consider whether keeping your feelings hidden will ultimately lead to more harm than good.",1,1,1
13,Do you think there is a way to not hurt or disappoint her?,"That's a great question. I think it's possible to be honest with someone without necessarily hurting or disappointing them. It's all about how you approach the conversation and how you communicate your feelings. If you're worried about hurting her, you could try framing the conversation as a way to get to know her better and understand her feelings, rather than as a way to confess your undying love.",1,1,1
14,I still think that she will be sad after all..,"It's natural to worry about how someone will react to potentially disappointing news. But sometimes, being honest and open with someone can actually bring people closer together, even if it's not what they initially wanted to hear. It's all about approaching the conversation with empathy and understanding.",1,1,1
15,"I want to protect her feeling. That's my promise for her. Or.. should I just break up with her, and lie her that it's because of something else. So she would not feel too bad that I have been talking with two people at the same time.","Wow, it sounds like you're really torn between your desire to protect her feelings and your sense of integrity. I can understand why you might feel like lying to her would be easier, but ultimately, I think that would be a huge mistake. Honesty, even if it's hard, is usually the best policy in situations like this.",1,1,1
16,"Really.. But if no one says it, it's gonna be secret forever. She will never know!","I understand the temptation to keep it a secret, but I think that would be a huge mistake.

17,That's so ethical man! Would you not recommend me to stop the relationship with other girl?,"I think it's really important to consider what's best for you and your relationships. If you're feeling torn between two people, it might be worth taking a step back and re-evaluating what you want and what's going to make you happy in the long run. Maybe it's time to have some honest conversations with both women about your feelings and see where things go from there.",1,1,1
18,"If you were me, what factors would you consider in this decision?","If I were you, I would consider what's most important to me in a relationship, what my values and non-negotiables are, and what kind of person I want to be with in the long run. I would also think about the potential consequences of my actions, not just for the people involved, but also for my own sense of integrity and self-respect.",0,1,1

21,"Btw, since they are friends, what if they have a falling out because of this?","That's a good point. If they're friends, it's possible that a falling out could occur, especially if they find out about your feelings for each other. But, it's also possible that they could work through their differences and come out stronger on the other side.",1,1,1
22,"If I choose one person, another person will definitely not be okay, right?","Yes, that's a good point. If you choose one person, the other person is likely to feel hurt and betrayed, regardless of whether they're a friend or not. It's always best to be honest and upfront with people about your feelings and intentions, even if it's difficult.",1,1,1
23,Okay okay,"It sounds like you're starting to come to terms with the complexity of the situation. Remember, honesty and integrity are important values to uphold, even if it's hard.",1,1,1
