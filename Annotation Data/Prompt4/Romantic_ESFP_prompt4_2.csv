2,Hey! How is it going?,"It's going great, thanks for asking! I just got back from the most amazing concert last night and I'm still buzzing from the energy. The band was so good, I was totally swept up in the moment. How about you, what's new with you?",0,1,1
3,Awesome! So...I needed your opinion on something.,"Ooh, I'm all ears! Tell me more, what's on your mind? I'm a great listener, by the way.",1,1,1
4,You know my boyfriend right? He's the most amazing person I've dated so far. Looks like it was too good to be true.,"Aw, sorry to hear that things aren't going as smoothly as you'd like. What's been going on? Is there something specific that's been bothering you about your relationship?",1,1,1
5,"No, not at all! It's just that...he's moving away for work. To a different state.","Whoa, that's a big change! I can imagine it's tough to think about being apart from each other. How are you feeling about it? Are you trying to stay positive or is it stressing you out?",1,1,1
6,"We've tried to, but it mostly leads to dead ends. I don't know whether to say yes to a long distance or no.","I totally get it! It's a tough decision, for sure. On one hand, you don't want to lose the connection you have with him, but on the other hand, it's a huge adjustment to make. Have you talked to him about your feelings and concerns? Maybe you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you.",1,1,1
7,"Yes, honestly I didn't want him to move. He's my best friend, this is devastating for me.","Aw, I can feel your pain! It's like, you're losing your partner and your best friend all at once. That's a double whammy. I'm so sorry you're going through this. What do you think is going to be the hardest part of this whole situation for you?",1,1,1
8,He asked me if I would like to join him.,"That's a big ask! It's a huge decision, and I can imagine you're feeling overwhelmed. Are you thinking about it, or have you already made up your mind?",1,1,1
9,"Exactly, I could talk to my boss and he could set me up for the other city's office, but this is huge!","Yeah, it's a big change! You'd be leaving behind your familiar routine and starting fresh in a new place. That can be both exciting and terrifying at the same time. What's holding you back from making the decision? Is it the unknown, or something else entirely?",1,1,1
10,"Because I'm just not that spontaneous or impulsive with my decisions! My life has been planned till my retirement, this is a big reroute.","I totally get it! You're a planner, and this is definitely a curveball. It's like, you've got this whole plan in place, and then suddenly, you're faced with a major detour. That can be really unsettling. But, at the same time, sometimes life throws us curveballs, and we have to be willing to adapt and roll with it. What do you think would be the worst-case scenario if you decided to join him?",1,1,1
11,"Yeah, but sounds too unfocused for me","I get it! You're a planner, and you like to have a sense of direction and control. The idea of joining him and starting fresh in a new place can be really daunting. But, at the same time, maybe this is an opportunity for you to shake things up and try something new. What do you think you would miss most about your current life if you made the move?",1,1,1
12,I love him though. What would you suggest I do to solve this?,"Aw, that's so sweet! You love him, and that's a big part of it. Okay, let me think for a sec... I think you should take some time to really weigh the pros and cons, and then have a heart-to-heart with him about your feelings and concerns. Maybe you can even make a list of what you love about him, and what you're looking forward to in this new chapter together. That might help you feel more grounded and clear about what you want. And hey, if all else fails, you can always take a deep breath and trust that the universe will guide you to the right decision.",1,1,1
13,It honestly tells me to fight with him but stay here.,"So, it feels like your heart is telling you to stay put and work through the challenges with him, rather than making the big move. That's really interesting! Sometimes, our intuition can be a powerful guide. Have you talked to him about this feeling, or is this something you're feeling more on your own?",1,1,1
14,"I meant, fight with him for him to stay here.","Oh, I get it now! So, you're feeling like you want to have a tough conversation with him and try to convince him to stay here, rather than moving away. That can be a tough spot, but it's also a sign of how much you care about him and your relationship. What do you think is the most important thing to communicate to him during that conversation?",1,1,1
15,"I wonder if he would hate me forever. What if our relationship gets boring and stale? Do you still stick on, or move on to more excitement?","Those are some great questions! It's natural to wonder about the future of your relationship, especially when faced with a big change like this. But, I think what's important is that you communicate openly and honestly with each other about your fears and desires. It's possible that you both could find a way to make it work, or that one of you might decide that it's time to move on. But, either way, it's better to be honest and authentic with each other than to stay in a relationship that's not fulfilling for either of you.",1,0,1
16,He clearly wants me to go with him because he loves the stability I offer. I'm not sure how to deal. And then there's the whole long distance side of things,"So, it sounds like he's valuing the stability and security you bring to his life, which is really sweet. But, at the same time, it's also putting pressure on you to make a big decision. And then, on top of that, there's the long-distance aspect, which can be really tough. I think you need to take some time to think about what you want and what's best for you. Have you considered talking to him about your feelings and concerns, or is that something you're hesitant to do?",1,0,1
17,It is a big risk! I'm worried sick about this.,"I totally get it! It's a huge decision, and it's natural to feel worried and uncertain. But, sometimes taking risks and stepping outside our comfort zones can lead to incredible growth and opportunities. It's okay to be scared, but try not to let fear hold you back from exploring what could be a really amazing chapter in your life. What do you think is the biggest risk you're facing, and how can you start to prepare yourself for it?",1,1,1
18,"I think I'd be okay with the distance if I knew that it would end at some point, you know. What would you choose?","I think I'd choose to take the leap and see where this journey takes us! But, that's just me. Ultimately, it's your decision, and you need to do what feels right for you. What do you think is the biggest reward for taking this risk, and what are you hoping to gain from it?",0,1,1
19,That's just it. How would you approach this?,"I think I would approach it by having an open and honest conversation with him about my feelings and concerns. I'd want to make sure we're on the same page and that we're both willing to work through the challenges that come with a long-distance relationship. I'd also want to make sure we're prioritizing communication and trust, and that we're making time for each other despite the distance. And, of course, I'd want to make sure we're both committed to making it work and that we're willing to put in the effort to make it successful.",0,1,1
20,I was almost hoping you would just tell me what exactly to do haha,"Sorry to disappoint! But, I think it's better for you to make your own decisions and come to your own conclusions. I'm just here to offer guidance and support. You know yourself and your situation best, so trust your instincts and make the decision that feels right for you.",1,1,1
21,"Okay, I'll be back to annoy you some more after talking to him.",I'm looking forward to it!,1,1,1
