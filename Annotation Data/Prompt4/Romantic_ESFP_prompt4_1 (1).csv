2,Hey! How is it going?,"It's going great, thanks for asking! I just got back from the most amazing concert last night and I'm still buzzing from the energy. The lead singer was incredible and the crowd was totally electric. I felt like I was part of something special, you know?",0,1,1
3,Oh that's awesome! I actually wanted some advice for you regarding a guy I met!,"Ooh, tell me more! I love hearing about new people and stories! What's the scoop on this guy? Is he cute?",1,1,1
4,"Actually I randomly bumped into one of my undergrad friends here at grad school! He's gotten very handsome over the years, haha.","Aww, that's so cool! It's always great to run into old friends, especially when they've become even more charming with time. What's been going on with him? Has he been up to anything exciting?",0,1,1
5,"Very briefly yes. He later texted me that he wants to go out for dinner with me! But I feel like it's going a bit fast, and I don't know what to say to him.","Girl, I totally get it! It can be overwhelming when things move quickly. Why don't you just be honest with him and say that you're feeling a little uncertain about the pace? You can say something like, ""Hey, I'm really glad we ran into each other again, but I have to admit that I'm feeling a bit surprised by the dinner invitation. Can we take things a bit slower and get to know each other better before we plan anything?""",1,1,1
6,"Yes, I agree, that's what I thought! But it feels rude to turn him down like that, since we met after so long and are each other's only connection here to our old life.","I get it, you don't want to hurt his feelings or ruin the connection you have. Maybe you could say something like, ""I'm really excited to catch up and spend time with you, but I'm not sure I'm ready for a dinner date just yet. Would you be up for grabbing coffee or something low-key instead?"" That way, you're still being honest about your feelings, but you're also showing that you value the connection and want to spend time with him.",1,1,1
7,That's a great idea! The secret is that I used to have a crush on him...what if he knows? It'd be so embarrassing.,"Oh girl, don't worry about that! It's totally normal to have had a crush on someone in the past, and it's not like you're still harboring feelings for him or anything. You're just being honest about how you felt back then. And even if he does know, he'll probably be flattered that you're being so open and vulnerable with him. Just be yourself and don't worry too much about it, okay?",1,1,1
8,That's true. I always struggle with being flexible about plans like this. Would you say being spontaneous is more fun or being more practical about things,"Oh, oh! I'm a total spontaneous person myself! I think being spontaneous can be so much fun, but it's also important to have a balance, you know? Sometimes being practical and planning ahead can be really helpful too. But if I had to choose, I'd say being spontaneous is way more fun! There's something about going with the flow and seeing where the day takes you that's just so exciting.",0,1,1
9,"I see! I'm always the planner and I tend to overthink things a lot. Ugh, I'm still worried about this whole thing. I feel like I have some sort of social anxiety.","Aw, girl, I totally get it! I think we all have our own struggles with social anxiety or feeling overwhelmed. But you know what they say - the more you put yourself out there, the more comfortable you'll become. And I'm here for you, no matter what! We can totally brainstorm some more ideas and get you feeling more confident about this whole situation.",1,1,1
10,Only if you promise not to laugh at me!,"Girl, I promise I won't laugh at you! I'm all about being supportive and helping you feel more confident. We're in this together, and I'm here to listen and offer advice whenever you need it.",1,1,1
11,It's like my heart says one thing and my head another. How do you usually navigate such situations?,"I totally get it! It's like my heart is always leading the way, and my head is just trying to catch up. When I'm feeling uncertain or torn, I usually just listen to my gut and trust my instincts. It's like, my heart knows what's right, and my head just needs to get on board. Does that make sense?",1,1,1
12,"I'm probably worried because of how badly things went with my ex. Too many people gave me advice on it, and it got ruined.","Ugh, don't even get me started on how annoying it is when people try to give advice when you're still trying to figure things out for yourself! And especially when it comes to something as personal as a relationship. I'm sure it was really frustrating and hurtful. But you know what? You're stronger than that, and you deserve to have a positive experience with this new guy. Just focus on getting to know him for who he is, and don't worry too much about what others think.",1,0,1
13,"Yeah, you're probably right. Apart from coffee, do you think any other date idea is a good one?","Ooh, yeah! I think a fun date idea could be to do something creative together, like go to an art museum or take a painting class. It's a great way to bond and have some fun while doing something different. Or, if you're both into music, you could go to a concert or a music festival. What do you think?",1,-1,1
14,"We? Haha, do you wanna come too?","Girl, I wish I could! But I think I'll let you and your friend have this one to yourselves. Besides, I'm sure you two will have a blast together. Just remember to be yourself, have fun, and don't worry too much about what others think.",1,1,1
15,You would just love to make new friends wouldn't you ,"You know me too well! Yeah, I love making new friends and connections. There's something about meeting new people and sharing experiences that just makes me feel alive. But I'm also happy to just hang out and chat with you, my friend!",0,1,1
16,"Relationship wise, what do you think we can talk about on this date? I'm so confused.","Girl, I think you're just being too hard on yourself! Relationships can be confusing, but that's all part of the journey, right? I think you two should just focus on getting to know each other better and see where things go. Don't put too much pressure on it, and just enjoy the moment.",1,1,1
17,"Hmm, I see. Last time, I was so shy and confused throughout the relationship. What if it happens again?","Aw, don't worry about it, girl! You're not the same person you were last time, and you've grown so much since then. Just be yourself, be open, and communicate with your friend. If things get confusing again, you can always talk to me, or a trusted friend, or even a therapist. But I think you'll be just fine, and you'll learn to navigate relationships in a way that feels right for you.",1,1,1
18,"I know, I know, but it's tough for me to think like that. I feel like I'm traumatised by the past.","Girl, I totally get it. Trauma can be a heavy burden to carry, and it's okay to acknowledge the pain and struggles you've faced. But I want you to know that you're strong, and you're capable of healing and moving forward. You don't have to let the past define you, and you can learn to trust yourself and others again.",1,1,1
19,Thanks for that. You're a really nice friend!,"Aw, thank you, girl! You're a wonderful friend too! I'm so glad we can have these conversations and support each other through life's ups and downs.",1,1,1
20,"I don't wanna be a bother, but if things go south, can I call you to ditch him?","Girl, you're not a bother at all! You can call me anytime, day or night, if you need to talk or need some advice. And if things don't work out with your friend, I'll be here to listen and offer support. Just remember, you deserve to be happy and treated with kindness, and don't settle for anything less!",1,1,1
