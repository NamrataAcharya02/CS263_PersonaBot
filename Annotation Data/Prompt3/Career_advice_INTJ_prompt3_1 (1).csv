I want to be a musician but my parents think being an engineer is more practical.",It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from your parents' expectations. It can be really hard to balance what others want for you with what you want for yourself. Have you considered talking to them about your feelings and concerns?,1,0,1
5,"I was hoping to get some advice on that. I love math and science, but music stirs my soul. At the same time, I know it may be volatile. What do I do?","It sounds like you're torn between two passions that speak to different parts of you. It's not an easy decision, but it's clear that you're trying to listen to your heart and your head. Can you tell me more about what specifically is drawing you to music, and what are your concerns about pursuing it as a career?",1,0,1
6,I wish someone would choose for me.,"It can be overwhelming to have to make such a big decision on your own. Sometimes it feels like everyone else has all the answers except for you.

9,"But I don't know what I want! I need some help or support, please tell me what you would pick.","I understand that you're feeling stuck and unsure. But as someone who cares about you, I want to encourage you to trust yourself and your own inner wisdom. What if, instead of trying to make the decision for you, I helped you explore your own thoughts and feelings about this?",1,0,1
10,Okay please don't get mad at me. I feel like I'm talking to my parents.,"I'm not here to judge or lecture you. I'm here to listen and support you. I understand that it can feel like you're talking to your parents when you're seeking advice, but I want you to know that I'm here as a friend, not as a authority figure. Can we start fresh and try to have a conversation that feels more like a collaboration?",1,0,1
11,"Alright so, I've been into music since I was a child. I feel like engineering will wear me out, while music will keep me going for years to come.",It sounds like music has been a source of joy and fulfillment for you for a long time.

Would you be able to make a living doing what you love?,1,0,1
12,"I tried telling them this. But they say that while they understand, they are worried about my stability. It can take decades to make it as an artist.

That's a valid concern, but it's also important to consider what will bring you fulfillment and happiness.",1,1,1
13,I'm worried though; I'm used to a life of luxury and comfort. What would you do in my place: be practical or passionate?. ,"That's a tough question. As someone who cares about you, I think I would want to encourage you to follow your passion, even if it means taking a risk. But I also understand the value of stability and security. Maybe the question is, what would make you feel most alive and fulfilled?",1,0,1
14,What if my parents stop funding me? Who will I turn to?,"That's a big concern. It sounds like you're used to having a financial safety net, and the thought of not having that is scary.

Who do you think you could turn to for support if your parents were no longer able to fund you?",1,0,1
15,"What confuses me is that I see their point. Being a software engineer will help me soar heights, make money and live comfortably. I also enjoy making things from the ground up. I can't seem to choose between my two loves. Help!",It sounds like you're torn between two paths that both resonate with you.

What do you think you would be giving up if you chose one path over the other?,1,0,1
16,Can you?,"Let's try. If you chose to pursue music, what would you be giving up? Would you be giving up the financial stability and security that comes with being a software engineer? And if you chose to pursue software engineering, what would you be giving up? Would you be giving up the creative expression and fulfillment that comes with making music?",1,0,1
17,That isn't such bad advice. I guess what you're saying is that it is important to be spontaneous than to think so much.,"Not exactly. I think what I'm saying is that sometimes, we get so caught up in weighing the pros and cons, and trying to make the ""right"" decision, that we forget to listen to our own hearts and intuition. It's okay to take a leap of faith, and trust that things will work out. And it's also okay to take your time, and weigh your options carefully. Ultimately, the most important thing is to make a decision that feels true to who you are, and what you want.",1,-1,1
18,I'm still confused.,"I think that's okay. Confusion can be a normal part of the process. Sometimes, we just need to sit with our thoughts and feelings, and trust that clarity will come when the time is right. Would you like to just sit with this for a bit, and see what comes up for you?",1,-1,1
19,Maybe I can live with you haha.,"I think that's sweet, but I don't think that's necessary! But seriously, it sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and uncertain. That's okay. We all go through that sometimes. Would you like to just take some time to breathe, and see what comes up for you?",1,0,1
20,"I'm serious! We can go out everyday, party, not worry about careers. ","I think you're trying to distract yourself from the uncertainty of your future, and I get that.

21,"Sorry, you're right. I'm just trying to lighten up the mood because I'm so stressed. ","I get it. Stress can be overwhelming. But, sometimes, we need to face our fears and uncertainties head-on.
