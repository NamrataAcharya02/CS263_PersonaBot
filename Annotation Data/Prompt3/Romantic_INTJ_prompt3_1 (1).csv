1,Hey! How is it going?,"It's nice to catch up with you. I've been doing alright, just taking some time to recharge and focus on my own things. How about you? What's been going on in your life lately?",0,1,1
2,Can we discuss something romantic today?,I'm happy to listen and support you in any way I can. What's been on your mind about romance? Is there something specific that's been weighing on you or something you're hoping to explore?,1,1,1
3,But this has been bothering me for so long. Can you please listen?,"I'm here for you, and I'm not going anywhere. Please, take your time, and share what's been bothering you. I'm all ears, and I'm here to listen without judgment.",1,-1,1
4,"One of my middle school friend became a popular actor, with 2M followers on social media. But I just happended to hear that I was his first crush!","Wow, that's quite a surprise! It sounds like a lot to take in. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling about this? Is it surprising, exciting, or maybe a little unsettling to know that someone you knew from way back when has become so successful?",1,1,1
5,"Back then, I kind of knew it that he liked me. But I didn't think that I would be his first love.",It sounds like there's a mix of emotions going on for you. You're probably feeling a sense of nostalgia and maybe even a little bit of wonder that it was you he had feelings for. Is it hard for you to reconcile the person you knew back then with the successful actor he is now?,1,1,1
6,I did not! We were not even that closed. I'm a bit flattered tho when I knew that he was talking about me.,"So it's more of a pleasant surprise, and you're feeling a bit flattered that he had feelings for you, even if it was a long time ago. It's interesting to think about how things could have turned out differently if you had pursued something romantic back then.",1,0,1
7,"Hahaha.. that's good point. So he was actually a cast in one popular movie about 'First love', so there was an interview asking each cast's real-life first love","That's so cool! It's no wonder he mentioned you then. I can imagine it's quite surreal to think about being a part of his first love story, even if it was just a crush.",1,1,1
8,I honestly think he is kind of cute..,"It sounds like you're feeling a little flutter in your heart! It's natural to have a positive reaction when we learn that someone we know has feelings for us, even if it's just a crush.",1,0,1
9,I might want to try meeting him in person tho.,"That's a big decision! It's understandable that you might want to reconnect with him, especially now that you know he had feelings for you. But are you thinking about meeting up with him just to catch up, or is there something more to it?",1,1,1
10,I am not sure.. I might hope something more..,It sounds like you're leaving the door open for the possibility of something more. Meeting up with him could be a great opportunity to rekindle an old connection and see where things go.,1,0,1
11,"How should I make a move, considering the fact that he is an actor now?","That's a good point! As an actor, he's probably used to being in the spotlight, and you'll want to make sure you approach the situation with sensitivity and respect for his career. Maybe you could start by reaching out to him through a mutual friend or a private message, and see how he responds before taking things further?",1,1,1
12,Reaching out to fan mail address?,"That's a bold move! Reaching out to his fan mail address could be a good way to get in touch with him, but you'll want to make sure you're prepared for the possibility that he might not respond or that it could be a while before he gets back to you.",1,0,1
13,Should I just ask for his number from other friends?,"That's a more personal approach! Asking a mutual friend for his number could be a good way to get in touch with him, but you'll want to make sure you're comfortable with the idea of potentially putting your friend in an awkward position.",0,1,1
14,Hahahah I was just kidding! I think approaching in social media sounds good!,"I was wondering if you were serious! Yeah, social media can be a good way to reach out to him, especially since he's an actor and has a public presence. Just be mindful of how you approach him and make sure you're respectful of his time and space.",1,-1,1
15,That's a good idea! But what if he is not interested in me any more?,"That's a very valid concern! It's always possible that his feelings for you have changed over time, or that he's not interested in pursuing anything romantic. But wouldn't it be worth finding out, even if it's just to clear the air and move on?",1,0,1
16,Wow.. I like your advice,"Aw, thank you! I'm glad I could help. It's always important to be honest with ourselves and others, and to approach situations with kindness and respect. Whatever happens, I hope you'll be happy with the outcome!",1,1,1
17,Thank you! You the coolest!,"Aw, shucks! You're making me blush! It was my pleasure to chat with you and offer some advice. I hope you'll keep me posted on how things go with your friend!",1,-1,1
