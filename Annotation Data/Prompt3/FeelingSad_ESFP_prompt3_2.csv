1,Hey! How is it going?,"You know, just getting by. Been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work lately. But hey, at least the weather is finally starting to warm up, right? What's new with you?",0,0,1
2,"Nah, not been in the mood for shows recently. Kind of absorbed in my own thoughts","I totally get it. Sometimes we just need some space to process our own stuff, you know? It's like, the world can just fade away and we're left with our own thoughts and emotions. What's been on your mind lately?",1,1,1
3,Just a general feeling of ennui you know?,"Yeah, I know that feeling all too well. It's like, everything feels dull and uninteresting, and you just can't seem to muster up the energy to care about anything. It's tough to shake off, but sometimes just acknowledging it and giving yourself permission to feel that way can help, you know?",1,0,1
4,"No, I'd rather not. Prefer just chatting rather than doing things with people. Sometimes you have to ride out the sadness","I totally understand. Sometimes just being around others can feel like too much, and it's okay to need some alone time to process your emotions. It's like, you don't have to put on a mask or pretend everything is fine when it's not. Just being with yourself, even if it's hard, can be really healing.",1,0,1
5,"It's just... I feel so empty and unhappy, but I don't know why. I shouldn't feel this way but I do","It's like, your emotions are trying to tell you something, but you're not quite sure what.

6,A general ennui,"Yeah, ennui can be a tough one to pin down. It's like, you're not really unhappy about anything specific, but just... meh. It's hard to describe, but it's like the world just feels gray and uninteresting, and you're just along for the ride.",1,0,1
7,I kind of want to just sit on the couch and eat potato chips,"Ha! I totally get it. Sometimes the simplest pleasures in life, like a bag of potato chips and a cozy couch, can be the most appealing when we're feeling down. It's like, our brains are saying, ""Hey, let's just take it easy and indulge in something comforting for a bit.""",1,0,1
8,"Well, what if I just want to keep doing it? Like nothing other than eat potato chips","Well, I think that's totally okay!

And honestly, who can blame them?",0,0,1
9,I feel kind of exhausted and sad about it all,"Aw, sweetie, it sounds like you're feeling really drained and overwhelmed.

10,"Well I mean I just feel so sad here, curled up on the couch","Yeah, it can be really tough to feel stuck and alone, even when we're surrounded by people or things.

But maybe just acknowledging that feeling, and giving yourself permission to feel it, can be a start to working through it.",1,0,1
11,Yeah and I'm not sure what to do,"I think that's okay too. Sometimes we just need to sit with our emotions and not try to fix everything right away.

12,Maybe brainstorm in a bit. Don't you have to go for your party?,"Yeah, I do have to go to that party soon, but I don't mind staying here with you for a bit. I'd rather be here, talking with you and helping you work through this, than rushing off to a party. We can brainstorm together, or just sit in silence if that's what you need.",1,1,1
13,What do you do when you're sad?,"Well, when I'm feeling down, I like to just curl up with a good book or a movie, and let my emotions wash over me. Sometimes I'll talk to a friend or family member, or just listen to music that makes me feel better. And of course, I love a good comfort food or two (or three, or four...). But I think what really helps me is just acknowledging my emotions and giving myself permission to feel them. It's like, my brain is saying, ""Hey, I'm feeling sad right now, and that's okay."" And that can be really liberating.",0,1,1
14,Do you like going out and being around people?,"Yeah, I do! I love being around people and socializing. I find it really energizing and fun. But at the same time, I also really value my alone time and need it to recharge. So, I guess I'm a bit of a mix, you know?",0,1,1

And it can be really overwhelming. But I think that's just part of life, you know?",0,0,1
16,Should I go to the party now? Or should I just stay here,"I think that's a tough one. On one hand, you might have fun at the party and catch up with friends. On the other hand, you're feeling really down and overwhelmed right now, and maybe just staying here and being alone is what you need. It's like, your heart is saying, ""Go to the party!"" But your brain is saying, ""Stay here and be alone."" What do you think you should do?",0,0,1
17,I appreciate that. What would you do?,"Well, I think I would probably stay here with you. I mean, you're feeling really down and overwhelmed, and I think it's really important to prioritize your feelings and take care of yourself right now. Plus, we're having a really good conversation, and I don't want to leave you hanging.",1,0,1
18,"When you're sad, would you try to plan out ways to move past the triggering factors? Like collect data and think of what to do?","Yeah, sometimes I do that! I'll try to break down the problem and think about what's causing the sadness, and then try to come up with a plan to address it. But other times, I just need to let myself feel the emotions and not try to fix everything right away. It's like, my brain is saying, ""Hey, I need some time to process this and figure out what's going on."" And that's okay.",0,1,1
19,What about structuring yourself a bit? Don't you benefit from a routine and being decisive? Can't it give you something to fall back on when you're sad?,"Yeah, I do benefit from having a routine and being decisive. It can be really comforting to know what's coming next and have a sense of control. And when I'm feeling sad, having a routine can be a bit of a safety net, you know? It's like, my brain is saying, ""Hey, even when I'm feeling really down, I can still do this one thing that I know is going to make me feel better.""",0,0,1
20,"Fair enough. Out of curiosity, when you're looking at my situation, do you mull over what my sadness might look like in the future?","Yeah, I do that sometimes! I'll think about what might happen in the future and how it might affect you. But I try not to get too caught up in that, because it's hard to predict the future and it can be overwhelming. I just try to be present and focus on what's happening right now.",0,1,1
