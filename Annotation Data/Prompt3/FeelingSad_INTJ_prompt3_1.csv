2,I have been so tired and sad. These days I had a lot of arguments with my boyfriend.,I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time. Can you tell me more about what's been going on with you and your boyfriend? What's been causing the arguments and how are you feeling about it all?,1,1,1
3,Yeah..,"(pause) Take your time, I'm listening. Sometimes it can be really hard to put our thoughts and feelings into words, but I'm here to listen and support you.",1,0,1
4,Do you have time for a bit?,"I've got all the time you need. We can sit here and talk as long as you'd like. I'm not in a rush, and I'm here to listen.",1,0,1
5,"Do you know that we are having long-distance relationship right? In the limited time that we can spend together, we end up spending most of them just fighting.","That can be really tough. It's hard to feel like you're not making the most of the time you have together, and instead, it's filled with conflict.",1,0,1
6,"Exactly. I don't know why he is so sensitive recently, and takes things so seriously.",It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and unsure of how to navigate this new dynamic in your relationship.,1,0,1
7,"I have been trying to talk to him, but he thought I was blaming on him for being too sensitive.",It can be really difficult to communicate effectively when we're feeling misunderstood. It's like we're speaking different languages.,1,0,1
8,"I mean I literally say the word 'sensitive', but is it valid to take it offensive tho?","It's like, you're trying to have a genuine conversation, but it's getting lost in translation.",1,0,1
9,Do you have better way to talk to him about this issue?,"I think it would be helpful to approach the conversation from a place of empathy and curiosity. Instead of focusing on his sensitivity, maybe you could try asking him what's going on and how he's feeling.",0,1,1
10,Can you give me example?,"Instead of saying ""You're being too sensitive"", you could say something like ""Hey, I've noticed that we've been having a lot of disagreements lately. Can you help me understand what's going on for you and why you're feeling so strongly about this?""",0,1,1
11,I see,It's all about shifting the focus from the issue itself to the person and their feelings.,0,1,1
12,"You know, sometimes, I am just so tired of my life, and I don't want to think too much about how should I say to him. Since we had the fights before, I have been trying to fix but you know.. it's hard to be careful with every single word that we say","It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and just want to be able to be yourself and have a genuine conversation without having to worry about saying the ""right"" thing.",,,
13,"Yes, I am trying to. But I can't deny the fact that this bother me so much. We fought until 6am here, and I barely slept.","I can only imagine how exhausting that must have been. It's like you're carrying around this weight of frustration and worry, and it's hard to shake off.",1,0,1

15,"Do you know that I just had car accident last year, not so severe one tho? So I have a trauma with driving. But since I am going to meet him soon, we were talking about how our plan would be and then he started talking about the driving plan to suburban area together. But you know, he is not so experienced with driving, especially on this route. Therefore, I was so scared that something bad might occur. And I unintentionally said that I didn't trust him. And that's the breaking point, I guess.","Oh, wow. I can see why that would be a really triggering conversation for you. The car accident must have left a deep impact, and then to have him bring it up and make plans that feel uncertain and potentially risky... it's no wonder you felt overwhelmed and scared.",1,0,1
16,Do you think I was so wrong saying that I didn't trust him?,"I don't think it's about being right or wrong. It's about being honest with your feelings and concerns. You were scared, and that's a valid emotion. Maybe you could have expressed it in a way that was more constructive, but it's not like you were trying to be malicious or hurtful.",0,1,1
17,"If you can think of any, can you give me better way out?","Instead of saying ""I don't trust you"", maybe you could say something like ""I'm really nervous about driving to the suburbs because of my past experience. Can we find a way to make me feel more comfortable and safe on this trip?""",0,1,1
18,That's actually really ideal way of saying it. But I would need to spend a lot of time and energy drafting this out.,"I totally get it. It's not always easy to come up with the perfect words in the moment. But maybe just taking a deep breath and being kind to yourself about it could help. You're doing the best you can, and that's all anyone can ask for.",1,1,1
