1,Hey! How is it going?,"You know, just getting by. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work and stuff lately. How about you, what's new with you?",0,0,1
2,No. Not really been in the mood for shows recently. Been bit of a downer,"Aw, sorry to hear that. It can be tough to get out of a funk, can't it? What's been going on that's got you feeling down?",1,0,1
3,Sigh. That might be a good idea. I need to get out of the house. It's just been a rough time recently,I totally get it. Sometimes just getting out and doing something different can help shake things off. Do you have anything in mind that you've been wanting to do but haven't had the chance yet?,1,1,1
4,Maybe we can just talk about it first?,"Yeah, totally. Sometimes talking about it can help clarify things and make it feel a little better. I'm here to listen, and we can just chat about whatever's been on your mind.",1,1,1
5,There's nothing in particular I guess. You know how you have uppers and downers? ,"Yeah, I think we all do! It's like, some days everything's going great and others it feels like the world is crashing down. But even the downers can be a reminder that we're human, right?",1,0,1
6,Yeah I'm there now. Stayed in bed for most of today. ,"Aw, sorry to hear that. It sounds like you really needed a day to recharge, though. Sometimes our bodies and minds just need a break, you know?",1,0,1
7,Thing is I have so many assignments to submit. ,"Ugh, yeah, that can be really overwhelming. It's like, you know you need to get stuff done, but it's hard to muster up the energy to even start. Do you feel like you're just staring at those assignments and feeling totally stuck?",1,0,1
8,But that's just the thing. I have so much going on but I just feel so exhausted and sad. ,"It sounds like you're feeling really drained, both physically and emotionally. It's like, you're trying to keep up with everything, but it's all just feeling like too much.",1,0,1
9,What do you think I should do now? ,"Honestly, I think you should just take some time to be kind to yourself. Maybe take a walk, watch a movie, do something that relaxes you and takes your mind off things. You don't have to tackle all those assignments right now.",1,1,1
10,What if I don't want to get out of bed? Can I just stay here forever? ,"Ha! I don't think that's an option, unfortunately! But seriously, it's okay to just stay in bed and take a break if that's what you need. Sometimes we just need to recharge and take care of ourselves before we can tackle everything else.",-1,0,1
11,"Can I just be lazy forever? Like just stay in bed for as long as possible, and ignore everything else?","I think we've all been there, right? Where it feels like the world can just wait and we can just stay in bed forever. But, I think deep down, we know that's not really an option. But for now, just for a little while, maybe just take a break and indulge in some laziness.",1,0,1
12,I just really need advice. What should I do?,"I think you're looking for some guidance, and I'm here to listen and offer some support. Sometimes just talking through our problems with someone who cares can help us figure things out. What do you think you need most right now?",1,1,1
13,I'm not so sure I want to see people right now,I totally get it. Sometimes we just need some alone time to recharge and process our emotions. It's okay to take a step back and prioritize your own needs right now.,1,1,1
14,What could be causing this general downturn in mood?,"It's hard to pinpoint sometimes, but it might be a combination of things. Maybe you're feeling overwhelmed with school or work, or maybe something personal is going on that's causing you stress. Sometimes it's just a natural ebb and flow, and we need to ride it out.",1,0,1
15,Why can't I just be sad? Why does it have to get better?,"I think it's because we're often taught to ""get over it"" or ""move on"" from our emotions, but the truth is, emotions are valid and it's okay to feel sad sometimes. It's okay to not be okay.",1,1,1
16,I guess that's true. I just want to curl up in a ball and have some alone time. I feel so sad,"Yeah, that sounds like exactly what you need right now. Sometimes we just need to wrap ourselves up in a blanket, watch some sappy movies, and let the tears flow. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take some time for yourself.",1,0,1
17,Are you still going to the party?,"Nah, I don't think so. I think I'll just stay in and hang out with you instead. You seem like you could use some company, and I'm happy to just chill with you and watch some movies or something.",-1,1,1
18,Yeah but I said I wanted some alone time.,"I'm sorry, I forgot. Yeah, you're right. You do need some alone time. I'll just go and leave you be.",1,0,1
19,Can't we just chat?,"Yeah, we can totally just chat. I'll just sit here with you and we can talk about nothing in particular. Or we can talk about whatever's on your mind, if you want. I'm just here for you, and I'm happy to just hang out and chat.",1,1,1
20,Thanks. I appreciate you as a friend,"Aw, thanks! I appreciate you too, buddy!",1,0,1
