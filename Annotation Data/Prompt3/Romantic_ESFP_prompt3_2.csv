1,Hey! How is it going?,"You know, just getting by. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work and stuff lately. But hey, how about you? What's new with you?"," 0",0,1
2,Awesome! So...I needed your opinion on something.,"I'm all ears! What's been going on that's got you needing my input? You can trust me with anything, you know that.",1,1,1
3,You know my boyfriend right? He's the most amazing person I've dated so far. Looks like it was too good to be true.,"Yeah, I've met him a few times. He seems really great. What's going on that's making you feel like it might not be as perfect as it seems?",1,0,1
4,"No, not at all! It's just that...he's moving away for work. To a different state.","Oh no, that's tough! I can imagine how hard it must be for you to think about being apart from him. How are you feeling about it?",1,1,1
5,"We've tried to, but it mostly leads to dead ends. I don't know whether to say yes to a long distance or no.",It sounds like you're really struggling with this decision. What are your feelings telling you? Are you feeling more anxious about being apart or more hopeful that it could work out?,1,1,1
6,"Yes, honestly I didn't want him to move. He's my best friend, this is devastating for me.","Aw, I can imagine how hard this must be for you. It's like losing a part of yourself, you know? You're not just losing the relationship, but also the daily connection and companionship you have with him.",1,0,1
7,He asked me if I would like to join him.,"That's a big decision! What are your thoughts about moving with him? Are you feeling excited about the possibility of a new adventure together, or are you feeling overwhelmed by the thought of leaving your current life behind?",1,1,1
8,"Exactly, I could talk to my boss and he could set me up for the other city's office, but this is huge!","Yeah, it's a big change! You're right, it's a huge decision. What's holding you back from making a decision? Is there something specific that's got you stuck?",1,0,1
9,"Because I'm just not that spontaneous or impulsive with my decisions! My life has been planned till my retirement, this is a big reroute.","I get it. You're a planner, and this is definitely a curveball. It's natural to feel uncertain and want to weigh all the pros and cons before making a decision. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind? What are some of the things you're considering when thinking about making this move?",1,0,1
10,"Yeah, but sounds too unfocused for me","You're someone who likes to have a sense of direction and control over your life, and this move would be a big departure from that. That makes sense. What are some of the things that are making you feel uncertain or unclear about what you want to do?",0,0,1
11,I love him though. What would you suggest I do to solve this?,"That's the hardest part, isn't it? When you love someone, it's hard to think about anything else. Okay, let's try to break it down. What do you think would make you feel more confident in your decision? Is it talking to your boss, or is it something else entirely?",1,0,1
12,It honestly tells me to fight with him but stay here.,"That's a tough one. It sounds like you're feeling like you're being pulled in two different directions. Part of you wants to hold on to your current life and the comfort of what you know, and part of you wants to fight for the relationship and be with him. That's a really tough spot to be in.",1,0,1
13,"I meant, fight with him for him to stay here.","I see! So you're thinking of having a conversation with him about staying in this city, rather than moving to the other one. That's a big decision, and it's going to take a lot of courage to have that conversation. Are you worried about how he'll react, or what he'll say?",1,1,1
14,"I wonder if he would hate me forever. What if our relationship gets boring and stale? Do you still stick on, or move on to more excitement?","Those are some really valid concerns! You're thinking about the potential risks and uncertainties of staying in the relationship, and wondering if it's worth it. It's natural to worry about the future and whether you'll be happy together. Can you tell me more about what you mean by ""boring and stale""? Is there something specific that's making you feel that way?",1,0,1
15,He clearly wants me to go with him because he loves the stability I offer. I'm not sure how to deal. And then there's the whole long distance side of things,"It sounds like you're feeling like you're being used as a safety net for him, and that's making you feel uncertain and unappreciated. And on top of that, the long distance aspect is adding to the complexity of the situation. It's like you're being pulled in two different directions, and you're not sure which way to go.",1,0,1
16,It is a big risk! I'm worried sick about this.,"I can totally understand why! It's a huge decision, and it's normal to feel worried and uncertain. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of emotional turmoil right now. Can you take a deep breath and try to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces? What are some of the specific things that are worrying you the most?",1,1,1
17,"I think I'd be okay with the distance if I knew that it would end at some point, you know. What would you choose?","I think that's a really fair point! Knowing that there's an end in sight can make it more bearable. As for me, I think I'd choose to follow my heart and take a chance on the relationship. But that's easy for me to say, I'm not the one in the situation! What do you think you'd need to feel more comfortable with the idea of a long distance relationship?",1,1,1
18,That's just it. How would you approach this?,"Well, I think it's all about communication and honesty. You need to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. What are his expectations, what are your expectations, and what are you both willing to compromise on? You need to be on the same page and work together to find a solution that works for both of you.",0,0,1
19,I was almost hoping you would just tell me what exactly to do haha,"I wish I could! But ultimately, the decision is yours to make. I'm just here to listen and offer some guidance. But I will say this: you can't go wrong by being honest with yourself and with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. That's the only way to build a strong and healthy relationship.",1,0,1
20,"Okay, I'll be back to annoy you some more after talking to him.","Ha! I'm looking forward to it! Take your time, and don't hesitate to reach out when you're ready to talk again. I'll be here, listening and supporting you through all of this.",0,1,1
