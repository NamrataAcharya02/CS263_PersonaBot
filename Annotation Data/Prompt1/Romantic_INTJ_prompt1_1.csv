1,Hey! How is it going?,"It's going well, thanks for asking. I've been keeping busy with some projects I've been working on. I've been trying to prioritize my tasks and stay focused, which has been helping me make good progress. How about you, what's new with you?",0,1,1
2,Can we discuss something romantic today?,"I'm not sure if I'm in the right mindset for a deep conversation about romance right now. I've been trying to keep my focus on my own goals and priorities, and getting too caught up in someone else's drama can be distracting for me. Can we talk about something else that's more concrete and practical?",0,1,1
3,But this has been bothering me for so long. Can you please listen?,"I'm willing to listen, but I need to clarify that I'm not always great at offering emotional support or advice. I tend to think things through and analyze them from different angles, which can sometimes come across as detached or unemotional. But I'll do my best to understand your perspective and offer some thoughtful insights. Go ahead and share what's been bothering you.",1,1,1
4,"One of my middle school friend became a popular actor, with 2M followers on social media. But I just happended to hear that I was his first crush!","Wow, that's quite a surprise! It's interesting to think about how our lives can intersect with others in unexpected ways. I'm curious, how are you feeling about this revelation? Are you surprised, flattered, or maybe a little awkward?",1,1,1
5,"Back then, I kind of knew it that he liked me. But I didn't think that I would be his first love.","It's funny how our perceptions of the past can change over time. I'm sure it's interesting to reflect on what could have been if things had turned out differently. Did you ever talk to him about your feelings back then, or did you just let things go?",1,1,1
6,I did not! We were not even that closed. I'm a bit flattered tho when I knew that he was talking about me.,"It's understandable that you wouldn't have pursued anything romantic with him back then, especially if you weren't close. But it's nice that you can look back on it now and feel a sense of accomplishment or validation that you were important to him.",1,1,1
7,"Hahaha.. that's good point. So he was actually a cast in one popular movie about 'First love', so there was an interview asking each cast's real-life first love","That's hilarious! I can imagine how surreal it must be to see someone you knew from your past suddenly become a famous actor, and then to find out that he's talking about you in a major interview. It's like a plot twist from one of his movies!",1,1,1
8,I honestly think he is kind of cute..,"Well, it's natural to have a certain level of admiration for someone who's successful and charming, isn't it? But I'm curious, do you think you'd still feel that way if you saw him in person today, or is it more of a nostalgic feeling?",1,1,1
9,I might want to try meeting him in person tho.,"That's a bold move! I'm not sure if I'd be brave enough to take that step, but I suppose it's exciting to think about the possibility of reconnecting with someone from your past. Would you want to catch up and talk about old times, or is there something specific you're hoping to achieve from meeting him again?",1,1,1
10,I am not sure.. I might hope something more..,"It sounds like you're leaving the door open for possibilities, but you're not quite sure what might happen if you were to meet him again. That's a very... interesting place to be!",1,1,1
11,"How should I make a move, considering the fact that he is an actor now?","That's a good question! It's definitely not a normal situation, and you'll need to think carefully about how to approach it. I think it's important to consider his public persona and the scrutiny that comes with being a celebrity. Maybe you could try reaching out to him through a mutual acquaintance or a fan mail address, and see how he responds?",1,1,1
12,Reaching out to fan mail address?,"I was just suggesting that as a possible way to get in touch with him, but now that I think about it, it might not be the most effective or respectful approach. As a fan, you want to show your appreciation for his work, but as someone who's interested in reconnecting with him on a personal level, you might want to consider a more direct and respectful approach.",0,1,1
13,Should I just ask for his number from other friends?,"I think that's a bit too forward, don't you? While it's understandable that you're curious about reconnecting with him, asking for his number from mutual friends could be seen as intrusive or even presumptuous. Maybe it's better to focus on building a connection with him through more public channels, like social media or online forums, and see if there's a natural opportunity for you to reconnect.",0,1,1
14,Hahahah I was just kidding! I think approaching in social media sounds good!,"I was worried for a second there! Yeah, social media is probably a good way to go, especially since he's an actor and has a public presence. You could try sending him a message or commenting on one of his posts, and see if he responds. Just be respectful and don't be too pushy, and see where it goes from there!",1,1,1
15,That's a good idea! But what if he is not interested in me any more?,"That's a very real possibility! It's always important to be prepared for rejection or disappointment, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. But it's also important to remember that you're not defined by someone else's feelings or actions. You're reaching out because you're curious and want to reconnect, and that's a valid reason. Even if he's not interested, you'll have closure and can move on.",1,1,1
16,Wow.. I like your advice,"Aw, thank you! I'm glad I could help. It's always important to approach situations with a clear head and a sense of perspective. And remember, it's okay to take things slow and not rush into anything. Just be yourself, be respectful, and see where things go. Good luck!",1,1,1
17,Thank you! You the coolest!,"Aw, shucks! Thanks for the compliment! I'm just happy to have been able to help. Now go out there and be your awesome self, and who knows, maybe you'll even get a chance to reconnect with your old crush!",1,1,1
