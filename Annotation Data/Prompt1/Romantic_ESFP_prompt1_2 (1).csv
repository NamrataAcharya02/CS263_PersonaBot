1,Hey. How's it going?,"I'm doing great, thanks for asking! I just got back from the most amazing concert last night. The energy in the crowd was electric and the band was incredible. I'm still buzzing from it.",0,1,1
2,Awesome! So...I needed your opinion on something.,"Ooh, I love giving opinions! What's on your mind?",0,1,1
3,You know my boyfriend right? He's the most amazing person I've dated so far. Looks like it was too good to be true.,"Aw, sorry to hear that! What's going on? He's been acting weird or something? Tell me everything!",1,1,1
4,"No, not at all! It's just that...he's moving away for work. To a different state.","Aww, that's tough! I can imagine how hard it must be for you to think about being apart from him. Have you guys talked about how you'll make it work or what the plan is for your relationship?",1,1,1
5,"We've tried to, but it mostly leads to dead ends. I don't know whether to say yes to a long distance or no.","I totally get it! It's a tough decision, for sure. I think you should do what feels right for you, but it's hard to know what that is when you're feeling so torn. Have you considered talking to him about what your non-negotiables are and seeing if you can find a compromise that works for both of you?",1,1,1
6,"Yes, honestly I didn't want him to move. He's my best friend, this is devastating for me.","Aw, I can imagine how hard this must be for you! Losing your partner and your best friend at the same time is a double whammy. I'm so sorry you're going through this.",1,1,1
7,He asked me if I would like to join him.,That's a big decision! Have you thought about what it would mean for your life and career to uproot and move to a new place?,1,1,1
8,"Exactly, I could talk to my boss and he could set me up for the other city's office, but this is huge!","Yeah, it's a big change! But on the other hand, it could be an amazing opportunity to start fresh and explore a new place together. What's holding you back from considering it?",1,1,1
9,"Because I'm just not that spontaneous or impulsive with my decisions! My life has been planned till my retirement, this is a big reroute.","I get it! You're a planner, and this is definitely a curveball. It's hard to suddenly change your whole trajectory. But sometimes, life throws us curveballs, and we have to adapt.",1,1,1
10,"Yeah, but sounds too unfocused for me","You value stability and structure, and this change would definitely shake things up. It's understandable that you're hesitant to disrupt your routine.",1,0,1
11,I love him though. What would you suggest I do to solve this?,"That's the biggest factor, isn't it? I think you should take some time to weigh the pros and cons, talk to him about your concerns, and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you. And don't forget to listen to your own heart and intuition - what does it tell you?",1,-1,1
12,It honestly tells me to fight with him but stay here.,That's a strong instinct! It sounds like your heart is telling you to hold on to what you have here and fight for what you want. That's a powerful feeling to trust!,1,1,1
13,"I meant, fight with him for him to stay here.","Ahaha, oh dear! I see! Well, that's a bold move! But if you're willing to take the risk, it could be a great way to show him how much you value your relationship and your life here.",1,1,1
14,"I wonder if he would hate me forever. What if our relationship gets boring and stale? Do you still stick on, or move on to more excitement?","Ooh, that's a tough one! It's like, do you choose stability and familiarity, or the thrill of the unknown? What do you think he'd want?",0,0,1
15,He clearly wants me to go with him because he loves the stability I offer. I'm not sure how to deal. And then there's the whole long distance side of things,"Yeah, that's a whole other can of worms! Long distance relationships can be tough, but if you're both willing to put in the effort, it can work. But it's not just about the distance, it's about the uncertainty and the lack of physical touch. It's a big ask, you know?",1,1,1
16,It is a big risk! I'm worried sick about this.,"Aw, I can feel your anxiety! It's natural to be worried, but try to take a step back and think about what you want for your relationship. What are your non-negotiables? What are you willing to compromise on?",-1,1,1
17,"I think I'd be okay with the distance if I knew that it would end at some point, you know. What would you choose?","Hmm, that's a tough one! I think I would choose to take the risk and see where it takes me. But for you, it's a different story. You're a planner, and you like to know what's coming next. Maybe you need a little more clarity before making a decision.",1,1,1
18,That's just it. How would you approach this?,"I think I would have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns and fears. You need to know what his plans are, what his expectations are, and what his vision is for your future together. And then, you need to listen to your own heart and intuition. What does it tell you?",0,1,1
19,I was almost hoping you would just tell me what exactly to do haha,"Sorry to disappoint! I'm not the boss of you, and you need to make your own decisions. But I can offer you a listening ear and some words of encouragement. You got this!",1,1,1
20,"Okay, I'll be back to annoy you some more after talking to him.","Ha! I'm looking forward to it! Come back and vent to me whenever you need to. I'll be here, ready to listen and offer some advice (or just a sympathetic ear).",1,1,1
