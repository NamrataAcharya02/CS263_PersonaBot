1,Hey! How is it going?,"It's going well, thanks for asking. I've been keeping busy with some personal projects and enjoying the quiet time to reflect. How about you?",0,1,1
2,"I have been going through a lot recently, especially about romantic relationship..",Sorry to hear that. It can be tough to navigate those kinds of situations. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? Sometimes talking about it can help clarify things.,1,0,1
3,"I have feeling for two people at the same time, and I don't know who should I choose..","That can be a really challenging and confusing situation. It sounds like you're feeling a strong emotional pull in two different directions. Have you tried to identify what specifically draws you to each person, or what your values and priorities are in a relationship?",1,0,1
4,The problem is I am in relationship with one of them. And another person is her friend,"That adds a whole other layer of complexity to the situation. It can be difficult to navigate relationships when there are already strong emotional bonds involved. Have you considered having an honest conversation with your partner about how you're feeling, or is that something that feels too overwhelming to tackle right now?",1,0,1
5,It's hard because we are not together right now.. I mean we are taking long-distance relationship,"Long-distance relationships can be tough to navigate, especially when there are feelings involved. It's natural to feel uncertain and unsure about what the future holds. Maybe you could try journaling or reflecting on what you want from your relationship and what your non-negotiables are?",1,1,1
6,What do you mean by non-negotiables?,"I mean the things that are essential to you in a relationship, the things that you absolutely need to feel fulfilled and happy. For example, honesty, trust, communication, or a certain level of emotional intimacy.",0,1,1
7,"Both of them are perfect.. pretty, smart, supportive, and rich","Wow, that sounds like a tough decision! It's not every day you come across two people who check off so many boxes. Have you considered what qualities or values are most important to you, beyond the surface-level traits?",1,0,1
8,"I just think that they both are so perfect. I can't really decide. Since I am taking long-distance with my partner, spending time with another girl helps ameriolate by loneliness","It sounds like you're using the other girl as a way to cope with the distance and loneliness, rather than thinking about whether she's a good match for you. Have you considered what your motivations are for spending time with her, and whether that's a healthy way to deal with your emotions?",1,0,1
9,My motivation is that she is HOT,"Well, it's natural to be attracted to someone who is physically appealing.

Are there any other qualities or characteristics that you're drawn to in her, beyond just her looks?",1,1,1
10,"I am just kidding man! Well, she is supportive and good at taking care. Whenever I am with her, the time just passes by so fast.","Well, it sounds like she's got some great qualities that make you feel comfortable and happy around her. But, I'm guessing you're still struggling with the fact that you're in a relationship with someone else. Have you considered what your partner would think if they knew how you were feeling?",1,0,1
11,I don't know if I should discuss with her. I am just too worried that she will be disappointed.,"It can be scary to have a conversation that might lead to disappointment or hurt feelings. But, it's also important to be honest with yourself and with others about how you're feeling. Maybe you could try framing the conversation as a way to clear the air and be honest with each other, rather than as a way to hurt or disappoint each other?",1,0,1
12,Do you think there is a way to not hurt or disappoint her?,"It's possible that there's a way to have the conversation without hurting or disappointing her, but it would require being very thoughtful and considerate of her feelings. Maybe you could try to have the conversation in a way that focuses on your own feelings and thoughts, rather than making judgments or criticisms about her.",1,1,1
13,I still think that she will be sad after all..,"It's natural to worry about hurting someone's feelings. But, it's also important to remember that you can't control how others react, only how you approach the situation. Maybe you could try to focus on being kind and respectful, and trust that she'll be able to handle whatever comes next.",1,1,1
14,"I want to protect her feeling. That's my promise for her. Or.. should I just break up with her, and lie her that it's because of something else. So she would not feel too bad that I have been talking with two people at the same time.","Wow, that's a tough decision. On one hand, you want to protect her feelings and avoid hurting her. On the other hand, lying to her about the reason for the breakup might be even more hurtful in the long run. It's a difficult choice, but it might be worth having a honest conversation with her, even if it's hard, rather than risking damaging the relationship with a lie.",1,1,1
15,"Really.. But if no one says it, it's gonna be secret forever. She will never know!","But sometimes secrets can be heavy to carry, and they can also damage relationships in the long run. Honesty, even if it's hard, can be a more liberating and respectful way to approach the situation.",1,1,1
16,That's so ethical man! Would you not recommend me to stop the relationship with other girl?,"Well, I think it's clear that you're struggling with feelings for both girls, and it's not fair to either of them to lead them on or keep secrets from them. Maybe it's time to take a step back and re-evaluate what you want and what's best for everyone involved.",1,1,1
17,"If you were me, what factors would you consider in this decision?","I would consider what's truly important to you, what your values are, and what kind of person you want to be. I would also think about the potential consequences of your actions, not just for yourself, but for the people involved. And I would try to be honest with myself about my feelings and motivations.",1,1,1
18,Wow.. that's impressive,"Thanks! I try to be thoughtful and considerate in my approach. But ultimately, the decision is yours to make. Just remember to be kind and respectful to yourself and others, no matter what you choose.",1,1,1
19,Am I really bad to be like this?,You're not a bad person for being conflicted and unsure. We all struggle with difficult decisions and conflicting emotions. The important thing is that you're taking the time to think about your feelings and consider the potential consequences of your actions.,1,1,1
20,"Btw, since they are friends, what if they have a falling out because of this?","That's a good point. If the two girls are friends, there's a risk that a falling out could damage their relationship. It's something to consider when making your decision.",1,0,1
21,"If I choose one person, another person will definitely not be okay, right?","Yes, that's true. If you choose one person, the other person will likely be hurt and possibly even angry.

22,Okay okay,"I think we've covered a lot of ground. Remember to be kind to yourself and others, and try to make a decision that aligns with your values and what's best for everyone involved.",1,1,1
