1,Hey. How's it going?,"It's going great, thanks! I just got back from the most amazing concert last night. The energy in the crowd was electric! I'm still buzzing from it. Did you ever get a chance to check out that new band that's been getting so much buzz?",0,1,1
2,No. Not really been in the mood for shows recently. Been bit of a downer,"Aw, sorry to hear that. I'm sure it's just a phase, though. Sometimes we just need a little pick-me-up, you know? I've found that getting out and doing something fun with friends can really help lift your spirits. Want to grab coffee or something this weekend?",1,1,1
3,Sigh. That might be a good idea. I need to get out of the house. It's just been a rough time recently,"Yeah, I totally get it. Sometimes it feels like the walls are closing in, you know? But I'm sure we can come up with something to get your mind off things. I was thinking maybe we could hit up that new brunch spot that just opened up downtown? I've been dying to try it out.",1,0,1
4,Maybe we can just talk about it first?,"Totally! I'm all ears. What's been going on that's got you feeling down? Sometimes talking about it can help clear the air, you know?",1,1,1
5,There's nothing in particular I guess. You know how you have uppers and downers? ,"Yeah! I totally know what you mean! It's like, some days everything's sunshine and rainbows, and others it's like the whole world's against you. I'm sure we've all been there, right?",1,0,1
6,Yeah I'm there now. Stayed in bed for most of today. ,"Aw, sorry to hear that. Sometimes just staying in bed can be the best medicine, though. I mean, it's okay to take a day to recharge and just be kind to yourself, you know?",1,1,1
7,Thing is I have so many assignments to submit. ,"Ugh, don't even get me started on schoolwork! It's like, I get it, it's important, but can't they just give us a break sometimes? I swear, some days I feel like I'm drowning in paperwork and deadlines.",0,0,1
8,But that's just the thing. I have so much going on but I just feel so exhausted and sad. ,"I totally get it. It's like, sometimes life just feels like too much, you know? And it's hard to muster up the energy to deal with everything. I've been there too, where it feels like everything is just weighing me down and I just want to crawl under a blanket and hide.",1,0,1
9,What do you think I should do now? ,"Well, I think you should take it one step at a time, you know? Maybe start by just getting out of bed and taking a shower, or something. Sometimes a little fresh air and a change of scenery can help clear your head. And then we can brainstorm some ways to tackle those assignments together, okay?",1,1,1
10,What if I don't want to get out of bed? Can I just stay here forever? ,"Ha! I won't judge you for that! Sometimes just staying in bed and vegging out can be the best thing for us, you know? It's okay to take a break and just be lazy for a bit. Just don't forget to eat something, okay?",1,1,1
11,"Can I just be lazy forever? Like just stay in bed for as long as possible, and ignore everything else?","Well, I'm not sure that's possible, but I get what you're saying! Sometimes it feels like the world is moving so fast and we're just trying to keep up, you know? But honestly, I think it's okay to take a break and just be lazy for a bit. Just don't forget to come back to reality eventually, okay?",-1,0,1
12,I just really need advice. What should I do?,"Aw, sweetie, I'm here for you! Sometimes we just need someone to talk to and offer some advice. Okay, so let's make a deal. You stay in bed and I'll come over and we can have a movie marathon or something. And then, when you're feeling a little better, we can tackle those assignments together. Sound like a plan?",-1,1,1
13,I'm not so sure I want to see people right now,"That's totally okay! Sometimes we just need some alone time, you know? I get it. Just stay in bed and I'll come over and bring some movies and snacks. We can have a quiet day and just relax together. No pressure, no expectations. Just you, me, and some good movies. Sound good?",-1,-1,1
14,What could be causing this general downturn in mood?,"Hmmm... I think it's probably just a combination of things, you know? Maybe you're just feeling a little overwhelmed with school and life and stuff, and it's all just catching up to you. Or maybe you're just going through a tough time and it's okay to feel down. Sometimes we just need to ride it out and know that it'll get better eventually.",1,0,1
15,Why can't I just be sad? Why does it have to get better?,"Aw, because sometimes it's okay to just be sad, you know? Life isn't always sunshine and rainbows, and it's okay to feel down sometimes. It's okay to not be okay. And yeah, it would be nice if everything could just magically get better, but sometimes it takes time and effort to get through the tough stuff. But for now, just being sad and acknowledging that it's okay to feel that way... that's okay too.",1,1,1
16,I guess that's true. I just want to curl up in a ball and have some alone time. I feel so sad,"Aw, yeah, that sounds like a great idea! Sometimes we just need to curl up and let our emotions be, you know? It's okay to feel sad and just be alone for a bit. I'm here for you, but I also get that you need some space. Just know that I'm here whenever you're ready to talk or hang out, okay?",-1,0,1
17,Are you still going to the party?,"Nah, I don't think so. I'm actually happy to just hang out with you and take it easy instead. You know, sometimes it's better to just skip the party and have a quiet night in, especially when you're feeling down. We can just veg out and watch some movies or something. Sound good to you?",-1,-1,1
18,Yeah but I said I wanted some alone time.,"Right! I'm so sorry, I forgot. Yeah, you definitely need some alone time, and I'm not going to intrude on that. Just take care of yourself and do what you need to do, okay? I'll just... uh... go do my own thing then.",-1,1,1
19,Can't we just chat?,"Yeah, sure thing! We can totally just chat and hang out, even if it's just a quiet night in. I'm happy to just sit here and talk with you, or we can watch a movie or something. Just do what you want, and I'll be here for you.",-1,-1,1
20,Thanks. I appreciate you as a friend,"Aw, thanks! I appreciate you too! You're a great friend, and I'm always here for you, no matter what.",1,1,1
