1,Hey! How is it going?,"It's going great! I just got back from this amazing concert last night and I'm still buzzing from the energy of the crowd. The band was incredible and I loved every minute of it. I even got to meet the lead singer after the show, which was a total thrill.",0,1,1
2,"Sounds great! I don't really want to ruin your good mood, but I've been struggling on making some important decisions recently.","Aw, sorry to hear that! But don't worry, I'm all ears! Let's grab a coffee and talk about it. Sometimes just sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone can help clarify things. What's been going on that's got you feeling stuck?",1,1,1
3,"I'm picking my career path, but I ended up with 2 options, and I don't know which one to go for.",That's tough! I can totally relate to having to choose between two great options. Have you tried making a list of pros and cons for each path? Sometimes writing it down can help you visualize the differences and make a decision feel more concrete.,1,-1,1
4,"I guess so, but it doesn't always leads to the best result.","Yeah, I know what you mean! Sometimes our brains can play tricks on us and we need to trust our gut instincts. Have you ever just gone with your initial feeling about which path feels more exciting or fulfilling to you?",1,1,1
5,"I'm picking between studying art and computer science. On one hand, art has always been my greatest passion, but it's not nearly as practical as computer science.","Wow, that's a tough one! I can see why you'd be torn. Art is such a beautiful way to express yourself, but computer science is definitely a valuable skill to have in today's world. Have you thought about how you could combine your love of art with your interest in computer science? Maybe there's a way to merge the two and create something totally unique!",1,1,1
6,That's interesting. I've never thought about that. I guess that would be a more ideal case.,"Exactly! And who knows, maybe that's the path you're meant to take. Sometimes the best solutions come from combining our passions and skills in unexpected ways. It's definitely worth exploring and seeing what kind of possibilities open up for you.",1,1,1
7,Right... But what if it doesn't work? What if I can only go with one thing but not the other?,"I totally get it! It's scary to think about giving up on something you're passionate about, but sometimes we have to make tough choices. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to still incorporate your love of art into your life, even if you choose to pursue computer science?",1,1,1
8,It's such a tough decision... What would you choose in this case?,"Honestly? I think I would choose the option that makes me feel most alive and excited! If art is what truly sets your soul on fire, then I would say go for it, even if it's not the most practical choice. Life is short, and we only get to do this once, right?",0,1,1
9,"I see... But I don't know if that works in my case. I'm not as talented as most people pursuing the path of art, and it's just a huge risk if I can't even make a living out of it.","I totally get it! It's smart to think about the practicalities, too. But maybe instead of focusing on being ""as talented"" as others, you could think about what unique perspective or voice you could bring to the art world? And as for the risk, maybe it's not about being 100% sure of the outcome, but about being willing to take a chance and see what happens.",1,1,1
10,"So you're saying that even if it doesn't work, I can still get something out of my experience?","Exactly! Even if things don't turn out exactly as you hoped, you can still learn and grow from the experience. And who knows, maybe you'll discover new passions or skills along the way that you wouldn't have found otherwise. It's all about being open to the journey, rather than just the destination.",1,1,1
11,I see... Then maybe I should give it a try?,"Yeah! I think so! You've got nothing to lose, and everything to gain. And even if it doesn't work out, you can always adjust course and try something new. But at least you'll know you gave it your all and took a chance.",0,1,1
12,I get it now. Thanks for the help!,"No problem! It was my pleasure to help. I'm glad I could help you see things from a different perspective. Good luck with your decision, and I hope you find a path that makes you happy and fulfilled!",1,0,1
