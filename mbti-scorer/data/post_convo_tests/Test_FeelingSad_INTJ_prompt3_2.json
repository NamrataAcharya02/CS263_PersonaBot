It sounds like a huge weight is crushing you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I am NOT okay at all. The worst part is that I needed to go to police station at 3am.

Such a tiring night!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ugh, that sounds like a nightmare. I can only imagine how humiliating and exhausting that must have been for you.

I don't get it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's because they're coming from a place of love and concern, but maybe not understanding the full scope of what you're going through.

But I think that this is the best idea ever!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I understand why you might think that, but I really think it's not worth the risk. You're already feeling guilty and stressed out, and sneaking around is only going to make things worse. Plus, it's not like it's going to solve the underlying problem or make your parents any happier.
