Well, she is supportive and good at taking care. Whenever I am with her, the time just passes by so fast."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(laughs) Ah, gotcha! Well, it's good to know that there's more to it than just physical attraction. It sounds like you're really connecting with this person on an emotional level, and that's something to be valued.
