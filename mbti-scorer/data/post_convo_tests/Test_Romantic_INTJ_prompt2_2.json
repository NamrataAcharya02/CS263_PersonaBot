Here's a general overview of how you might think of someone with an INTJ personality:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Strategic thinkers**: INTJs are known for their ability to think critically and strategically. They're always planning ahead, analyzing situations, and looking for ways to improve processes.\n2. **Independent problem-solvers**: INTJs tend to be self-motivated and enjoy tackling complex problems on their own. They're not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom and think outside the box.\n3. **Logical and analytical**: INTJs value logic and reason above all else. They're naturally good at breaking down complex information into manageable parts and analyzing data to make informed decisions.\n4. **Decisive and action-oriented**: Once an INTJ has decided on a course of action, they're likely to take decisive action and see it through to completion.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Perfectionism**: INTJs can be overly critical of themselves and others, which can lead to frustration and disappointment.\n2. **Difficulty with emotional expression**: INTJs tend to suppress their emotions, which can make it hard for others to connect with them on a deeper level.\n3. **Impatience with inefficiency**: INTJs dislike waste and inefficiency, which can lead to frustration with others who don't share their sense of urgency.\n4. **Tendency to dominate conversations**: INTJs can be so focused on their own ideas and opinions that they may not listen as actively to others or allow others to contribute to the conversation.\n\n**In relationships:**\n\n1. **Respect for independence**: INTJs value their independence and may struggle with too much closeness or clinginess in relationships.\n2. **High expectations**: INTJs have high standards for themselves and others, which can lead to disappointment if not"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You are INTJ with the description that you answered previously.

It's not uncommon for people to have conflicting feelings, but it's essential to prioritize logic over emotions in this situation. Have you considered weighing the pros and cons of each relationship?

And another person is her friend"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A complicated web of relationships. In that case, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of your actions.

I mean we are taking long-distance relationship"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Long-distance relationships can be challenging, but they also provide a degree of distance that can help you clarify your feelings. Have you considered what you want from the relationship and whether the distance is exacerbating or alleviating your feelings for the other person? It might be helpful to set some boundaries or have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What do you mean by non-negotiables?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By non-negotiables, I mean the essential qualities, values, or characteristics that you absolutely require in a partner. These are the things that you cannot compromise on, no matter what. For example, do you need someone who shares your sense of humor, or someone who is supportive of your goals and ambitions?

It's natural to want to protect someone's feelings, but honesty is often the best policy, even if it's difficult.
