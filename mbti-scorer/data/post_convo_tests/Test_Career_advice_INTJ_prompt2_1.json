I want to be a musician but my parents think being an engineer is more practical."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A dilemma. As someone who values efficiency and effectiveness, I'd say it's essential to consider the practicality of a career choice. However, it's also important to follow your passion and pursue what truly interests you. Have you considered the intersection of music and engineering? There might be ways to combine your creative and analytical skills."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I was hoping to get some advice on that. I love math and science, but music stirs my soul. At the same time, I know it may be volatile. What do I do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A classic conflict between head and heart. As someone who values logic and analysis, I'd say you need to weigh the pros and cons of each option.
