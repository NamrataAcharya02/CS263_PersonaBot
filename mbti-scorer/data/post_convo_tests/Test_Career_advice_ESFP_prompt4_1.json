I love how we can just be ourselves around each other, no judgment or expectations. What's been on your mind, friend?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks! I think I am a bit stressed lately."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can totally relate! Sometimes life can feel like it's moving a million miles an hour, and it's hard to keep up.
