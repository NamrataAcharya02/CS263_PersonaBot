It can be really hard to balance what others want for you with what you want for yourself. Have you considered talking to them about your feelings and concerns?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I was hoping to get some advice on that. I love math and science, but music stirs my soul. At the same time, I know it may be volatile. What do I do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It sounds like you're torn between two passions that speak to different parts of you.

I guess what you're saying is that it is important to be spontaneous than to think so much."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not exactly. I think what I'm saying is that sometimes, we get so caught up in weighing the pros and cons, and trying to make the \"right\" decision, that we forget to listen to our own hearts and intuition.
