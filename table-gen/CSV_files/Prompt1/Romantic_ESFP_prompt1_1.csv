1,Hey. How's it going?,"I'm doing great, thanks for asking! I just got back from this amazing concert last night and I'm still buzzing from the energy. The band was so good, I ended up singing along with everyone else in the crowd. Have you heard of them?",,,
2,Oh that's awesome! I actually wanted some advice for you regarding a guy I met!,"Ooh, spill the tea! What's the scoop on this guy? Did you hit it off or is it just a casual thing?",,,
3,"Actually I randomly bumped into one of my undergrad friends here at grad school! He's gotten very handsome over the years, haha.","Aww, that's so sweet! It's always great to reconnect with old friends, especially if they've turned into a handsome stranger. Did you guys catch up on everything that's been going on in each other's lives?",,,
4,"Very briefly yes. He later texted me that he wants to go out for dinner with me! But I feel like it's going a bit fast, and I don't know what to say to him.","Yeah, it can be weird when old friends suddenly want to take things to the next level! I think you should just be honest with him - tell him you're flattered, but you need some time to think about it and get to know each other again before making any big plans.",,,
5,"Yes, I agree, that's what I thought! But it feels rude to turn him down like that, since we met after so long and are each other's only connection here to our old life.","I get it! It's tough to say no to someone who's reaching out, especially when there's a lot of history between you two. Maybe you could suggest doing something low-key, like grabbing coffee instead of a fancy dinner? That way, you can still spend time together, but it's not as big of a commitment.",,,
6,That's a great idea! The secret is that I used to have a crush on him...what if he knows? It'd be so embarrassing.,"Oh no, that's a lot of pressure! But honestly, if you're worried about it, you could just be upfront and tell him how you feel. It's better to be honest and clear about your intentions than to worry about what might happen. Plus, if he's a good friend, he'll probably understand and appreciate your honesty.",,,
7,That's true. I always struggle with being flexible about plans like this. Would you say being spontaneous is more fun or being more practical about things,"Oh, totally spontaneous! I mean, don't get me wrong, being practical has its place, but sometimes you just have to go with the flow and see where things take you. Life's too short to overthink every little thing, you know?",,,
8,"I see! I'm always the planner and I tend to overthink things a lot. Ugh, I'm still worried about this whole thing. I feel like I have some sort of social anxiety.","Girl, I totally get it! I'm a bit of a worrier too, and social situations can be super overwhelming. But honestly, the more you worry about it, the more you'll psych yourself out. Just take a deep breath, relax, and remember that it's okay to make mistakes. And hey, if it all goes wrong, you can always laugh about it later, right?",,,
9,Only if you promise not to laugh at me!,"Ha! I promise, I promise! I'll be your biggest supporter and cheerleader. Now, let's go grab that coffee and face your fears together!",,,
10,It's like my heart says one thing and my head another. How do you usually navigate such situations?,"Totally! I'm all about listening to my gut instinct. If it feels right, I go with it. And if it doesn't, I trust my instincts and make a change. It's all about being true to yourself, you know?",,,
11,"I'm probably worried because of how badly things went with my ex. Too many people gave me advice on it, and it got ruined.","Ugh, don't even get me started on toxic advice from well-meaning friends and family! It's like, they mean well, but it's not their relationship, you know? You deserve to figure things out for yourself and make your own decisions. And hey, maybe this new guy can help you move on from the past and find a fresh start.",,,
12,"Yeah, you're probably right. Apart from coffee, do you think any other date idea is a good one?","Ooh, yeah! I think a fun outdoor activity would be great! Like, have you ever been to that new park that just opened up? We could grab a picnic and go for a hike. It's casual, relaxed, and you can get to know each other in a really natural way.",,,
13,"We? Haha, do you wanna come too?","Ha! No, no, no! I was just suggesting it as an idea. But now that you mention it, that sounds like a lot of fun!",,,
14,You would just love to make new friends wouldn't you ,"You caught me! Yeah, I love meeting new people and making connections. There's something about finding common ground and shared experiences that just makes my heart happy.",,,
15,"Relationship wise, what do you think we can talk about on this date? I'm so confused.","Girl, I'm all about being real and authentic! I think you should just be yourself and see where the conversation takes you. Ask him questions, share your thoughts and feelings, and see if you both connect on a deeper level. And hey, if it doesn't work out, at least you'll have a good story to tell, right?",,,
16,"Hmm, I see. Last time, I was so shy and confused throughout the relationship. What if it happens again?","Aw, don't worry about it! You're gonna be just fine. Just remember that it's okay to be yourself, even if that means being a little shy or unsure. And hey, if things get awkward, you can always laugh it off and move on. Life's too short to stress about it too much, you know?",,,
17,"I know, I know, but it's tough for me to think like that. I feel like I'm traumatised by the past.","Sweetheart, I totally get it. Trauma can be really tough to overcome, and it's normal to feel like it's still affecting you. But the thing is, you're strong, and you're capable of healing. Just remember that you're not alone, and that you can get through this. And hey, maybe this new guy can be a part of your healing process, you know?",,,
18,Thanks for that. You're a really nice friend!,"Aw, shucks! You're making me blush! I'm just happy to be here for you, girl! We're gonna get through this together, and I promise you'll come out stronger on the other side.",,,
19,"I don't wanna be a bother, but if things go south, can I call you to ditch him?","Girl, you're not a bother at all! I'm here for you, no matter what. And yes, if things go south, you can totally call me and we'll ditch him together!",,,
