1,Hey! How is it going?,"I'm doing great, thanks for asking! But I have to say, you look a bit stressed. Is everything okay? You can tell me if something's on your mind, I'm all ears!",,,
2,Hey! How is it going?,"I'm doing fantastic, thanks for asking! But I can tell you're not quite yourself today. What's going on that's got you feeling a bit off? I'm here to listen and help if I can.",,,
3,"Sounds great! I don't really want to ruin your good mood, but I've been struggling on making some important decisions recently.","Don't be silly, I'm here for you! Decisions can be tough, and it's totally normal to feel overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's been weighing on your mind? Sometimes talking about it helps clarify things.",,,
4,"I'm picking my career path, but I ended up with 2 options, and I don't know which one to go for.",Career choices can be really tough! It sounds like you're feeling stuck between two great options.

5,"I guess so, but it doesn't always leads to the best result.",I totally get it! It's scary to make a decision and then worry that it might not be the right one. But sometimes just taking the leap and going with your gut can be really empowering. What do you think is the biggest risk or fear associated with each option?,,,
6,"I'm picking between studying art and computer science. On one hand, art has always been my greatest passion, but it's not nearly as practical as computer science.","Wow, that's a tough choice! It sounds like you're really torn between following your heart and being practical. What do you think your friends and family would say if you chose art, and what about if you chose computer science?",,,
7,That's interesting. I've never thought about that. I guess that would be a more ideal case.,"Exactly! It's always helpful to consider how others might see your decision, even if it's not the only factor. Sometimes just acknowledging those perspectives can help you feel more confident in your choice. What do you think you would regret more, not following your passion for art or not being practical with computer science?",,,
8,Right... But what if it doesn't work? What if I can only go with one thing but not the other?,"The what-ifs can be really overwhelming, can't they?

You're strong and capable, and I have no doubt you'll find a way to make your passion and practicality align.",,,
10,"I see... But I don't know if that works in my case. I'm not as talented as most people pursuing the path of art, and it's just a huge risk if I can't even make a living out of it.","I get it. You're worried about the uncertainty and the potential financial struggles. That's a really valid concern. But maybe it's not about being talented or not talented, maybe it's about being willing to take the risk and put in the effort to make it work. What's the worst that could happen if you choose art, and what's the best that could happen?",,,
11,"So you're saying that even if it doesn't work, I can still get something out of my experience?","Exactly! Even if things don't turn out exactly as you hoped, you can still learn and grow from the experience. And who knows, maybe the journey itself will lead you to new opportunities and discoveries that you wouldn't have found otherwise.",,,
12,I see... Then maybe I should give it a try?,"Yeah! I think you should definitely give it a shot! You'll never know what could happen if you don't try. And even if it doesn't work out, you'll know that you took a chance and went for it. That's a pretty empowering feeling, don't you think?",,,
13,I get it now. Thanks for the help!,"You're welcome! It was my pleasure to help. I'm glad I could help you see things from a different perspective. Remember, you're strong and capable, and you can do anything you set your mind to!",,,
