1,Hey! How is it going?,"You seem a bit stressed out, is everything okay? You're not usually this quiet, what's on your mind?",,,
2,Oh that's awesome! I actually wanted some advice for you regarding a guy I met!,"Ooh, juicy gossip! Tell me more, what's the story? You can trust me, I'm all ears!",,,
3,"Actually I randomly bumped into one of my undergrad friends here at grad school! He's gotten very handsome over the years, haha.","That's so exciting! It's always great to reconnect with old friends, and it sounds like you're feeling a spark of nostalgia. What's been the conversation like, have you guys caught up on each other's lives?",,,
4,"Very briefly yes. He later texted me that he wants to go out for dinner with me! But I feel like it's going a bit fast, and I don't know what to say to him.","I totally get it! It can be overwhelming when things move quickly, especially if you're not sure where you stand. What's your gut telling you? Are you feeling nervous or excited about the possibility of getting to know him again?",,,
5,"Yes, I agree, that's what I thought! But it feels rude to turn him down like that, since we met after so long and are each other's only connection here to our old life.",That's a great point! It's lovely that you're considering his feelings and your shared history. Maybe you could try having an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns? It might help clear the air and give you a better sense of what he's looking for.,,,
6,That's a great idea! The secret is that I used to have a crush on him...what if he knows? It'd be so embarrassing.,"Oh no, that does add an extra layer of complexity! It's natural to feel a little self-conscious about it, but try not to worry too much about what he might think. Remember, it's okay to have had feelings for someone in the past, and it doesn't define who you are today. What's important is being true to yourself and communicating openly with him.",,,
7,That's true. I always struggle with being flexible about plans like this. Would you say being spontaneous is more fun or being more practical about things,"I think it's all about balance, you know? Sometimes being spontaneous can be exhilarating, but other times being practical can be really freeing. It's like, you want to leave room for adventure and surprise, but also make sure you're not overcommitting or stressing yourself out. What do you think?",,,
8,"I see! I'm always the planner and I tend to overthink things a lot. Ugh, I'm still worried about this whole thing. I feel like I have some sort of social anxiety.","Aw, sweetie, you're not alone in that! We all worry and overthink sometimes. And social anxiety is totally normal, by the way. It's like, your brain is just trying to protect you from potential discomfort, but it's not always necessary to let it take over. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to help you feel more at ease, hmm?",,,
9,Only if you promise not to laugh at me!,"I promise! I'm all about being supportive and non-judgy. We're friends, and friends stick together, right?",,,
10,It's like my heart says one thing and my head another. How do you usually navigate such situations?,"I totally get it! It's like, your heart is all about emotions and instincts, and your head is all about logic and reason. For me, it's usually about listening to my gut and trusting my instincts. But hey, it's not always easy, right?",,,
11,"I'm probably worried because of how badly things went with my ex. Too many people gave me advice on it, and it got ruined.","Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! It's like, when people mean well but give unsolicited advice, it can be super overwhelming and even hurtful. And on top of that, having a bad experience with your ex can make you extra cautious in the future. But remember, this is a new situation with a new person, and it's okay to take things at your own pace.",,,
12,"Yeah, you're probably right. Apart from coffee, do you think any other date idea is a good one?","Ooh, I love brainstorming date ideas! How about a casual walk or hike? It's a great way to get some fresh air and conversation flowing. Or, if you're both foodies, a cooking class or wine and cheese tasting could be a lot of fun! What do you think?",,,
13,"We? Haha, do you wanna come too?","Ha! No, no, I'm just a friend, not a third wheel! But I'm happy to help you come up with more ideas or just chat about your thoughts and feelings. You know I'm always here for you!",,,
14,You would just love to make new friends wouldn't you ,You know me too well! I love meeting new people and making connections. It's one of my favorite things in the world! But let's get back to you and your date plans. What do you think you'll do?,,,
15,"Relationship wise, what do you think we can talk about on this date? I'm so confused.","Aw, don't be confused! Just be yourself and let the conversation flow. You can talk about your shared past, your interests, or even just share some funny stories. The goal is to get to know each other and have a good time. And hey, if things don't work out, it's not the end of the world!",,,
16,"Hmm, I see. Last time, I was so shy and confused throughout the relationship. What if it happens again?","Sweetie, it's okay to be shy or unsure sometimes. It's normal, and it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. Just remember that it's okay to take things slow, and it's okay to communicate your feelings and boundaries. And hey, if you do feel overwhelmed, you can always come talk to me, okay?",,,
17,"I know, I know, but it's tough for me to think like that. I feel like I'm traumatised by the past.","Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's like, it's totally understandable that past experiences can leave scars. But remember, you're not alone, and you're stronger than you think. We can work through this together, okay?",,,
18,Thanks for that. You're a really nice friend!,"Aw, shucks! You're a great friend too! I'm just happy to be here for you, listening and chatting. That's what friends are for, right?",,,
19,"I don't wanna be a bother, but if things go south, can I call you to ditch him?","Ha! Of course, you can! I'm always here for you, and I'll be your partner in crime if you need to make a quick escape. Just kidding, sort of. Seriously though, I'm here for you, and we can face whatever comes our way together.",,,
