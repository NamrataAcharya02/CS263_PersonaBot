1,Hey! How is it going?,"It's great to catch up with you! You look like you're carrying a weight on your shoulders, though. What's been going on that's got you looking a bit stressed?",,,
2,Hey! How is it going?,"I'm doing alright, just busy with work and stuff. But I'm really happy to talk to you, how about you? What's new and exciting in your life?",,,
3,"Ow I see. Sorry to hear that. Actually, I'm having issues with jobs too.","Oh no, sorry to hear that! It can be really tough when things aren't going as planned. What's been going on with your job that's got you feeling stuck?",,,
4,"Actually, I don't have a job yet. I'm still choosing my career path.","I totally get it! That can be a really overwhelming and uncertain time. It's like, you're trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do with your life. What are some things that are weighing on your mind as you think about your career path?",,,
5,Yup. I think I finally came up with 2 options. I can either study computer science or art.,"Wow, that's a tough choice! Both options sound really interesting, but in different ways. What is it about computer science that's drawing you in, and what about art is making you want to explore that path?",,,
6,"Yeah... That's where the issue comes from. Art has always been my passion, and artist is definitely be my dream job. On the other hand, I don't think I'm good enough to make a living being an artist, so I should probably go with something more practical, like studying computer science and working as a software engineer.","I can totally understand the struggle! It sounds like you're torn between following your heart and being realistic about your future. It's like, you want to pursue something that brings you joy, but you also want to be responsible and secure.",,,
7,I don't know. I just feel like nothing will make me as excited as drawing.,"That's so true! When we're doing something we love, it's like our hearts are fully engaged, and we feel so alive. It's hard to imagine giving that up, even if it means taking a risk. What do you think would happen if you did pursue art, even if it wasn't a ""practical"" choice?",,,
8,"That is what has been bothering me. It feels like I'll sacrifice my potential to live descently if I study art, but I'll probably sacrifice my happiness if study computer science instead.","Yeah, it's like you're facing a tough choice between two different kinds of sacrifices. It's hard to know which one is the right choice, but maybe the question is, what kind of life do you want to live? Do you want to look back and think, ""I took the safe route, but I'm not really happy""? Or do you want to take a chance and pursue something that brings you joy, even if it's not the most conventional choice?",,,
9,I guess that would be helpful.,"I'm glad I could help! It's always good to take a step back and think about what's truly important to us. Remember, it's okay to take risks and try new things - it's all part of the journey, right?",,,
10,I am also wondering what would you do in situations like this. Would you either pursue your passion or just be practical if you can only pick one?,"Honestly, I think I would probably choose to follow my heart and pursue my passion, even if it's not the most practical choice. For me, the thought of living a life that's not true to who I am is way more scary than the thought of taking a risk and potentially failing. But, I'm a bit of a dreamer, so what do I know?",,,
11,I see... Maybe it's worth the risk to live with what I enjoy.,"Exactly! I think that's a great way to look at it. Life is short, and we should try to make the most of it. If you can find a way to make a living doing something you love, that's a huge bonus. And even if it doesn't work out, you can always adjust and try something new. But at least you'll know you gave it your all and followed your heart.",,,
12,Yeah. I think I've made my decision.,"That's great to hear! It sounds like you've been thinking a lot about this, and you've made a decision that feels true to who you are. I'm really happy for you!",,,
13,"Thanks! I'm not nearly as talented, but I'll try my best. Hope I can at least afford my living expenses living as an artist lol","Aw, don't sell yourself short! You're already taking the first step by pursuing your passion, and that takes a lot of courage. And who knows, you might be more talented than you think! As for living expenses, you can always find ways to make it work. Maybe you'll find a way to monetize your art, or maybe you'll find a way to make a living that complements your artistic pursuits. The important thing is that you're taking a chance and following your heart.",,,
