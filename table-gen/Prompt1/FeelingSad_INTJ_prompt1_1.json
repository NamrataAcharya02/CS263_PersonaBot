In the limited time that we can spend together, we end up spending most of them just fighting."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I can imagine how frustrating that must be. It's hard to feel like you're not even getting a chance to really connect with each other. It's like you're just going through the motions and fighting instead of really talking and listening to each other."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Exactly.

It can be overwhelming to feel like you're walking on eggshells all the time, trying to avoid saying the wrong thing. It's exhausting, and it's no wonder you're feeling drained.

But since I am going to meet him soon, we were talking about how our plan would be and then he started talking about the driving plan to suburban area together. But you know, he is not so experienced with driving, especially on this route. Therefore, I was so scared that something bad might occur. And I unintentionally said that I didn't trust him. And that's the breaking point, I guess."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wow, that's a lot to process. I can see why you would be anxious about driving with him, especially given your past experience. And it's understandable that you would feel scared and worried about something going wrong. It's like, you're trying to protect yourself, but it comes out as not trusting him."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Do you think I was so wrong saying that I didn't trust him?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's more about how you said it, rather than the fact that you were worried about his driving abilities.

Sometimes it's easier to just go with what feels natural, but like you said, it might not be the most effective way to communicate. Maybe you can practice what you want to say ahead of time, so it feels more natural and less forced when you do have the conversation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wow.. That's actually really ideal!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm glad I could help!
