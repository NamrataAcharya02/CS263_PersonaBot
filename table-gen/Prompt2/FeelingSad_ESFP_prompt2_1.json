Been bit of a downer"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Aww, sorry to hear that! You know what they say, \"when life gives you lemons, make lemonade\"... or in my case, when life gives you a downer, grab your besties and go get some ice cream!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sigh. That might be a good idea. I need to get out of the house. It's just been a rough time recently"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Girl, I totally get it!
