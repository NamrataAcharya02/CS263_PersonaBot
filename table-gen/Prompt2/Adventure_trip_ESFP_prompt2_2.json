What do you say?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "We just want to visit somewhere new and take a break from the school stuff."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I totally get it! Sometimes we all just need to get away from it all and recharge. I was thinking of heading to the beach, it's supposed to be gorgeous this time of year.
