## table_gen:
To use this, please edit the settings.yml in `./table_gen/` and change the input json and output csv names. Make sure you include the extension at the end. 
Then, just run the jsonParser with `python jsonParser.py`. Note that you should probably run it from inside the table-gen directory.
